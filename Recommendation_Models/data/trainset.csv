We all shared different cuts of meats and they were all delicious and cooked to perfection. The wine list offered a very nice selection from all the major wine regions. The craft cocktail list was over the top. Maybe a little too extra if you want my honest opinion. Nonetheless, this is a 5 star place with five star food and beverages.

Maybe I wasn't really expecting anything... Or maybe I was expecting more without really expecting anything in particular? 

I had heard that the mussels were delicious. I LOVE mussels, but I was alone in that boat, and the 2 pounds of muscle portion seemed like a bit much for me at the time, so I figured I would come back another time. I ended up ordering some sort of fruity beer. It was pretty good. VERY sweet and bitter. Almost wine-like, but good. After I had gorged myself on my dinner, I was glad that I had gotten the fruity beer because I don't think I would have been able to continue drinking any other type of beer with my stuffed belly. 

For dinner, well, the menu didn't leave much for me to actually give you a name of what I had. So. For dinner, I had some sort of meatball, and something (beer?) swiss cheese blah dee blah. Yeah. That was the name of it, or soemthing like that. Thank you for giving me a name to call in for short. And ordering it? Do I call it meatball and you just know before I finish? Or do I finish the whole name (or rather, construction of the meal) of it? 
All it all, it was okay. The bread was a bit stiff, as it was toasted, and swallowed the meatballs, cheese and sauce. 
The fries (OH, SORRY! Frites!- They were fries, really) were not special. The sauces were special, though. I ordered horseradish and sesame mayo. I usually feel kinda bad getting mayo- like I should be making a more healthy choice for myself, but I LOVE sesame. The horseradish was good, but man, that sesame mayo was GREAT! 

Really, the food was eh. The beer was pretty good (I'm sure I'll like the regular wheat. Actually, I tried the black wheat, and it was really good! )- The ambience was nice- I liked the atmosphere a lot, even if we were getting eaten alive by mosquitos and had several visits by either separate spiders or the same one. 

I might change my mind when I go back for the mussels, but I thought the food was pretty mediocre. I had heard so much about the frites, and eh. 

They ARE open 'till 12:30, though. I like that, so there's more chance to win me over. I'm a late night diner, and I'll be back to give it another shot.",2011-07-06 16:20:42

Our server was friendly and helpful. And the menu basically breaks into two sections: German sausages and hamburgers. We tried both. 
The hamburger was better. The patty is on the thin side, but fresh beef and ingredients give it a good flavor. 
The sausages also had a good flavor, but were a little dry. The sauerkraut that came with them was very good.

HOWEVER,  I'm doing it.  It's New Year's Day. The only place open on Mass Ave is here,  and they have a great brunch. We just wanted drinks which is why we sat at the bar. The greeter was warm and made us feel welcome. There were two other staff members who were very cordial. I don't know what the problem was with the bartender. We sat down and told him we just wanted drinks. I asked him if they had a brand,  and he looked at me like I had three heads and said he'd never heard of it. Well,  check with your Mass Ave business neighbors because at least three of them carry it. I opted for a standard. After he served our first drinks,  he never asked us if we wanted anything again. I finally said,  ""Yo Adrian!"" to a lovely young lady who really is named Adrian and who was already working her butt off and asked her if I could get another drink. She got it for me. We had a total of three drinks in two hours. Then we had to ask for the check. This just really chaps me. It's unacceptable behavior and service.

It takes it name from the nearby Devil's Half Acre, originally a stone tavern built in the 18th Century close on the Delaware River that sold alcohol and other services to the river traffic navigating upstream and down in a time the the river was the primary means of transportation in this part of colonial America. In fact, they had no license to make nor sell alcohol, and the joint was a place where violence and shady characters abounded. Legend and history say there were many people killed there and buried in the backyard. 

Perhaps, to lessen the reliance on that unsavory history, the name was chosen without the word ""Half,"" but the connection is not lost on those aware of these facts. Still, it appears often enough in the menu and on the walls of the establishment to hint at the local lore. 

Luckily, this house is totally legit. Ownership has created an attractive utilitarian space, German American in nature, with excellent cross section of Deutsch brews, quality cocktails, reasonable happy hour choices and a strong kitchen. We stopped in on Saturday afternoon at the start of HH, and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. After a little confusion with our new server about availability of happy hour and where to sit to capture those prices, everything was resolved quickly and we waited for delivery to our dining room table of Three Onion Soup, Dragon Wings and Pierogi of the Day apps/sides, and two DHA Burgers and a DHA Dog. 

Everything was very good to terrific. My stepson wouldn't share his potage, so it must have been great. We all sampled the wings @$.50 per. They were not too big, but were amply meaty with a good sweet/hot glaze with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. The pierogi were the weak link. The dough was thick, too chewy and dominated the flavor of the seasoned veggies within. Ate one and took the rest home. Maybe sour cream would have helped. 

The burgers were huge with double patties, bacon, lettuce, red onion, and their DHA sauce. Both were past the medium well finish requested, but there was still plenty of flavor and moisture. I loved the double dog with chopped red onion, dark mustard and well done bacon in a fresh crisp torpedo roll. Great taste and texture. @$5 HH price it was a star of the show. 

Devil's Acre Tavern is a 35 minute drive from home, but when in the mood for German beer and cuisine it is well worth the trip. Tuesday Burger Night sounds like a winner, too.",2019-10-06 15:44:01

Clayton, our host and server had his act together and brought all of us coffee as we perused the breakfast menu.  Various omelets for my family and friend, and French Toast for me.  While the conversation gathered momentum, the plates were brought out and laid before us.  Everything looked very good, although I only tasted the homemade Potato Chips, which were good.

My French Toast was off the mark, however. I had asked for it ""crunchy,"" and was told it would be left on the grill longer to make it all well done.  What came out with the real Maple Syrup were a half dozen pieces of French Demi Loaf that were actually lukewarm at best, and far from the cauterized ends I requested.  I was surprised given the repartee at the ordering.  They had not been on the grill long enough, and had been off the grill too long before serving. Wrong on both sides.  Disappointing, but not wanting to poop on the party I ate everything and enjoyed the real Maple Syrup.

I love seeing the food trucks outside of the big summer events.  It may just be me, but I seldom encounter trucks just around town very often, and I love to jump at getting to stop by one in the ""food truck off-season"".  Beyond that, I also love, love, love Hawaiian food, so this is right up my alley.

Setup should be familiar to any food truck enthusiast.  These folks set up at different spots on different days, you walk up, place your order, and either take it to go or find a seat and enjoy your meal.  They have two or three main courses, some sides, as well as drinks.  Today I ended up going for the Kalua Pork platter, coming with rice and macaroni salad, along with a side order of their Asian slaw, all for like $12.  Good deal, for sure.

All in all, this is some of the best Kalua Pork I've had in our region.  These guys get top marks for that alone, and make me excited to try some of their other entrees when next I can track them down.  The macaroni salad was pretty good, with lots of garlic, though the addition of olives doesn't strike me as very ""island"", except maybe if you mean Mediterranean island.  The slaw was quite nice, too, with a light yet sweet sauce that really helped cut the richness of the pork.

If you are looking for good Hawaiian-style food, definitely give their webpage a look, check their calendar for upcoming locations, and keep an eye out at any big events or food truck gatherings in hopes that the Aloha Shack makes an appearance.

Which was good since my kiddos didn't care for their mini corn dog nuggets and tater tots that looked like what I reheat at home, and my sandwich was just so so (it felt peppery just to be peppery, instead of it being a necessary part of the taste?). The place is super laid back, the waitstaff were cool, and there's no beating a place with a variety of beer and TWO different outdoor seating areas.

I went for restaurant week. Honestly the food was pretty good, even if not ""traditional"" so I don't have any complaints about that. The bbq pork was delicious, maybe one of my favorite pork dishes I've had in a while. My main complaint is the portion sizes- for the price, you really do not get a ton of food. I went for restaurant week lunch and got 4 courses but my party went out to get second lunch after. 

The pork belly bao was alright at best- nothing special but it wasn't bad either. The Kobe beef slider was also pretty good, but again, not incredible anyway and the portion is tiny- I've had real Kobe steak in japan and it was ok a completely different level, the ""Kobe beef slider"" is basically slightly nicer ground beef. The dip sum donuts are basically fried dough covered in sugar- while the sauces are interesting, it's nothing mind blowing. As I said earlier, the bbq pork is the only thing that stood out. 

Service was okay until we got to dessert- for some reason it took 30 minutes just to make the dessert. We were basically ignored for half an hour while everyone else got their entire meals.

Hosts were all fantastic, even sought us out to tell us how much longer it would be for a table and make sure we had gotten a drink. Love the Ms. PacMan and other video games in the entrance and there's a pool table in the back (I wish there was skeeball but that's like wishing there was a unicorn). Decor is cool, but they need more concert posters to balance out the expanse of wall space. Surprisingly, the noise level was acceptable. Tables are well-spaced so you're not going to be rubbing against other diners as you eat (like at Refinery). 

My boyfriend stood at the bar for 15 minutes and was pretty much ignored by all 4 people behind the bar. He claimed they avoided making eye contact. I went in. I caught the eye of one bartender fairly quickly, he greeted me, and took my drink order about 5 minutes later. After 10 more minutes I finally had my cocktail and boyfriend's beer. Nice beer selection, I was delighted with my Major Award cocktail. I love bourbon, egg white cocktails, and A Christmas Story. Really great flavor. 

The covered patio area is very pleasant. That's where we sat while waiting for our table. I wish there was a firepit for those cool nights. 

Our food came out in an acceptable amount of time but I was disappointed in the portion size and quality when compared to the price. I had the rabbit and dumplings, $24. There were 2 biscuit-style dumplings which tasted fine, and then there was shredded rabbit and copious celery with some slightly undercooked potatoes. The lima beans (one of my favorite veggie beans) were nowhere to be found. I thought it was possible they could've been pureed but the flavor and texture of the stew made me think it was not so. It tasted fine, but I have had better rabbit, better stew, and even better rabbit stew at or below this pricepoint. I was still hungry after finishing my entree. 

He had the fried chicken. The pieces were so small they may have come from a bantam. Seriously tiny pieces of chicken. They were also very dark brown...which would've been fine had the people to either side of us been eating chicken of that color...theirs was much lighter. For his 2 sides he chose cornbread and tomato rice. I tried both. The cornbread was good and the tomato rice was AMAZING. That was the star of our food experience. 

Our server never checked on us until our last few bites, when she asked if we saved room for dessert or just wanted the check. Water had run out awhile before this. We were very near the server's station and she walked by us probably 20 times. Unacceptable to not have an additional check-in or more water brought. 

To recap...nothing was terrible but the only amazing things were my cocktail and the tomato rice. Experience was ""fine"". A-ok in the truest sense. I appreciate the unique menu and what they're trying to do. I'm sure that things will only get better as they're open longer. 

We spent as much as we did the last time we went to Rooster & the Till or Ulele. Except unlike the other 2 spots, I left feeling hungry and that the service was subpar (except for the awesome hosts).",2015-01-08 08:11:45

So if you come in and sit down and no one even talks to you for 10-15 minutes despite the fact that they're standing right in front of you pouring beers or washing glasses, persevere! Flag them down! Call out! Wave your hand! The pizza (and beer) are worth it. 

There is seating for about 30 people inside (maybe 6 tables plus stools at the bar), and there's a courtyard outside too. If you have a group of 10, please don't come here. The kitchen is small, and you'll take up, very literally, ALL of the chairs. If you do decide you simply must come here with a larger group, have the decency to get only one check...for the sake of the other customers. 

I love the selection of beer here. There are 7 tap handles so there's pretty much always 6-7 draft beers to choose from. They're all microbrews or eurobrews. The offerings are balanced. It's not going to be ""4 IPAs, plus 3 others""...look forward to a stout, a porter, a pilsner, a hefeweizen, an IPA, and maybe even something barrel-aged or a sour. BUT WAIT...THERE'S MORE! The entire back wall and about half of another wall are lined with beer in bottles and cans. Again, all craft and euro. Many hard to find. 80% or more are cold and ready for you to drink with your pizza or carry home to drink. Not a beer drinker? Well, there's craft soda and juices for you. 

There are games for the kids (or adults) to play. There's a community bulletin board. There's a stream of neighborhood people passing by (this is Tampa Heights, so anything goes). 

The pizza is FANTASTIC! This is my favorite pizza in Tampa, hands-down. The crust is chewy and the perfect thickness, lightly sprinkled with Italian herbs, lightly bubbled and not soggy. The sauce is bright and fresh-tasting. Toppings are evenly spread and there are plenty to choose from. The cheese is gooey and strings nicely. My go-to is: meatballs, fresh basil, spinach, and ricotta. MMMmmmm!! It's tastes like a lasagna pizza. My boyfriend gets sausage and pepperoni...he's a traditionalist. 

The entire menu is pizza or baked wings. If you have a limited diet for whatever reason (vegan, celiac, dairy allergy), this may not be your cup of tea. 

There is a record player but the needle has been broken for the entire time I've lived in Tampa. The flatscreen TV sits on top of the record player. I'm a sad panda.",2015-02-16 19:44:29

The coffee was also delicious. Can't wait to come back - maybe for dinner :)",2017-09-26 00:25:53

We got the sausage w/ cornbread and poached egg dish, the roasted cauliflower w/ pickled carrots and cucumbers, the parmesan frites, and the grand slam risotto.  The sausage was a pork sausage and was very good, and the cornbread and poached egg with it just made the dish rich and rustic.  The roasted cauliflower was, well, roasted cauliflower; and the pickled carrots and cucumbers were an interesting surprise - I still can't decide if I really like it or not...  The parmesan frites were fantastic - perfectly cooked and seasoned too perfection.  And the grand slam risotto was the bomb.

So I'll say the only thing that I enjoyed was watching the firework candle that they give to the person having the birthday, but even at that, it took them 2 tries to get it right because the first try the fireworks were shooting in the chandelier so they had to get another one because we didn't have enough time to take photos because of the server having to adjust everything because the shooting fireworks. Even at that, while we were waiting for the second candle to come out, it took them forever while ALL of us were waiting with cameras. They had no sense of urgency. We waited about 10 min before the server came out again with the candle. 

Food wise, not great either. I ordered the Alcapulco poke bowl, full size and a dynamite crab roll. The alcapulco bowl was filled with WAY TOO MANY BEETS and too many peppers. It made the bowl pretty much not good to eat. I just picked at the tuna, which was overcooked, and ate it. Dynamite crab roll was decent but not exceptional. 

Also I ordered the SLAMgria. This was where the worst part happened. The guy running the drinks from the bar delivered the drink, and when he brought t in front of me, his hands were shaking and it dropped ALL over my pants. He didn't acknowledge or say anything about it either. The drink is pretty much a coronarita but with a bottle of champagne. But the bottle had already poured out all in the cup.

I ordered three rolls and was given the complimentary soup and salad - both of which were a-ok.

The sushi arrived and it was pretty good, but I felt that there wasn't much fish in my rolls. What fish was in there was good enough, but certainly not the freshest tasting sushi I've ever had.

First the fantastic, the drinks.  Before we went I read that you could get all you can drink mimosas and bloody marys.  I did not expect them to give each person who ordered that an unlimited supply of bottles of champagne!  They also gave us a couple shots of vodka to make bloody marys.  They had 8 different types of juice for the mimosas!  I ended up loving the mango and sticking with that.  They also had a couple bloody mary mixes and all the fixins.  If you feel like getting hammered early afternoon on a Sunday, this is your place.

Honestly, the food was just ok in comparison.  You can opt out of the drinks for a cheaper price (although then I don't see this brunch as worth it and you don't get access to the seafood).  They have a variety of brunch foods and desserts.  Really nothing special, but not terrible either.

I'm actually surprised by the amount of people who have given this place a good review.  Now, I'm not saying the food was bad, but I think this meal was worth $20, not $50.

First, the service was very slow.  There were only a couple other tables there so I'm surprised it took us so long to get our food.  It got to the point that my husband and I started trying to calculate how long we had sat there for (we estimated about 45 minutes) before getting our entrees.  It took a while to get our salads and then after they took away our salad we sat and waited for our entrees.  That put a damper on the evening.

We both got caesar salads.  They were fine, nothing special, but the croutons tasted like they came out of a bag.  Again, at this price point I was pretty underwhelmed.

I got the Grouper and my husband got the Chicken Parmesan.  I think the Grouper was fried.  That surprised me.  However, everything tasted good.  The Chicken Parmesan was also good, but the penne it came with tasted exactly like something we could make at home with dry noodles and marinara sauce from a jar.

This is another place I ventured to thanks to Yelp. I saw that many Yelpers visited and raved about this place, so I had to check it out. Pro tip: make a reservation. The waitress seemed to visibly relax when I told her I had a reservation. It's a small place, so calling ahead is a must. (Random fact: I called six times to finally get through to make a reservation. It's up to you about whether you are that obsessive, but I seriously think we may have been turned away if we didn't have that reservation. Note that we were there on mother's day, so it may have been busier than normal).

I went with the roasted chicken plate. I know, I struggled with whether I should order the fried chicken or not, but in the end, I decided my health is important and non-fried chicken can still be good. I chose cole slaw and mashed potatoes for my sides. I also ended up taking home an appetizer of wings for my husband (after reading Dave W.'s review, I couldn't come here and not get them). 

This is going to sound super weird, but I ended up enjoying the chicken more cold the second day. It is so much food that I took half the chicken home and ate it the next day for breakfast. I found the chicken a tad dry at the restaurant, but when I ate it later it was super tender. It might have been that the portion of the chicken I saved was a juicier part, but I absolutely devoured that chicken the second day. This brings me to a conundrum with this review. I would probably give the chicken I ate at the restaurant four stars, but the chicken I ate at home was definitely five stars worthy. I think the chicken wings are going to have to tip this over to five stars. They were plump, juicy, and I absolutely loved them. Also, I'm not sure how healthy their food is, but I definitely felt like a health superstar eating it.

I had high hopes for Carrabba's. My husband and I have accumulated a ton of gift cards over the past couple of years and it is finally time for us to start redeeming them. I do appreciate that Carrabba's gift cards also work at Bonefish, Outback, and Fleming's, since they are all owned by the same parent company, Tampa-based Bloomin Brands. Honestly, what sealed the deal about which restaurant we went to came down to two factors: I wanted free bread and to go to a restaurant I hadn't been before. Although I adore Fleming's and Outback is always a solid bet, we have been to the ones closest to our house and I like to try new things. I knew there was a Carrabba's in Clearwater and I read they serve complimentary bread before the meal so that sealed the deal.

After reading some yelp reviews, I saw that it can get busy on a Friday night (thank you yelpers!). To avoid one of my all-time pet peeves of waiting to eat, I went to their website right before we left to put us on the ""waitlist"". This basically put us in line before we got there. When we arrived, it was packed. They told the people in front of us that it was about a 15 min to 20 min wait. There were people sitting outside and inside waiting to be seated. When I checked in, they found me on their online system and told me it was about a 20 minute wait! This was exceptionally frustrating, because the people in front of me obviously did not check in online, because they had to give the hostess all their information, and they were told the same wait time. I asked the hostess the point of their online system and she vaguely said that it would help us skip a couple people. This did not fly with me, but after a couple minutes of stewing, my name was called that our table was ready! It took about five minutes and that was without me even expressing my frustration with the online system. It really works! Crisis averted, they get a star just for that.

The bread came and at first I thought, why is it such a tiny loaf? Me and my American bias. It was warm and the size turned out to be fine, but I'm not in love with this bread. Usually when I think about carbs I enjoy I immediately think, I need some of that now (like Newk's croutons or Maggiano's bread), when I think of Carrabba's bread, I just think meh. My husband got the Chicken Marsala and I got the Johnny Rocco's salad. The Chicken Marsala came with either soup or salad so he chose a Caesar salad. It was absolutely drenched in dressing. He didn't enjoy it, because he wasn't a fan of the dressing. He felt it was off. I thought the dressing was fine, there was just so much of it! He also wasn't a huge fan of his Chicken Marsala. He felt like the sauce was just poured on the chicken and there wasn't really a marsala flavor to the actual chicken. The garlic mashed potatoes were fine. I was also disappointed by my salad. I enjoyed the grilled shrimp and scallops, but the handful of cheese was an odd presentation. It was like someone just dumped cheese on my salad and called it a day. It wasn't a very impressive salad to me. At first I thought I was just being picky, but the next day we went to Grill One Sixteen and I had a house salad to start and I realized that I do know when I love a salad and the Johnny Rocco just didn't do it for me. It needs something more than just scallops, shrimp, a smattering of roasted red peppers, and cheese. It is definitely missing something. 

I have a feeling everyone else here has their favorites, probably a pasta, something breaded, or a super cheesy dish, and come here for that. Unfortunately, this place just doesn't do it for us. Lucky for them, they are packed with people, so I'm sure they won't miss us.",2017-01-23 21:25:36

I might have liked this place better if it wasn't called Toast. I would think that by being named after toast, their bread would be fantastic. There is a quote on the wall that says toast is a name for grilled cheese, I'm totally paraphrasing, but that's how I remember it, but even a good grilled cheese needs good bread. The bread here is just the normal loaf you can get at Publix. It was fine, but nothing remarkable. 

The meal itself went along those same lines, it was fine, but nothing remarkable. I got a Greek Omelet with hashed browns. I liked the tzatziki sauce that came with it and I smothered the omelet in it. Otherwise, there wasn't that many piece of gyro meat and the pieces that were there had a manufactured look to it. I put ketchup on the hashed browns to give it some taste. Overall, I wasn't upset with my meal, but I don't really care to repeat it. 

The service was prompt and there weren't that many people there at noon on a Friday. This does seem like a good place to bring young kids, because it was pretty casual.",2019-04-19 12:40:01

I've actually wanted to try Capital Tacos for a while. I had heard great things so I had it on my list of restaurants to try. My friend threw out a last minute invite that she was driving up to Wesley Chapel to meet up with other friends at Capital Tacos and the draw of hanging out with them and Capital Tacos made me say yes - taking an impromptu trip to Wesley Chapel is much more rare now that I have the baby, whom I left with the husband.

Since it was an impromptu trip I didn't get to do the research I normally do before trying a place - i.e. look at the menu and read Yelp reviews. We were late so when we got there we immediately went to stand in line. I got to the front way too quickly and decided in a split second on the Hen House bowl. 

It came quickly which was good, but the actual meal didn't wow me. All the flavors kind of fell flat and I found the pieces of chicken a little small. I honestly like Chipotle better and it pains me to say that because I feel like Capital Taco is an institution. I talked to a friend after who loves Capital Taco and said that it could be that as they grow they become more uniform across the locations and lose some of their charm. 

The space itself is bright, open and inviting. It is a great place to bring a family. 

I wish I liked my meal here better. Being that Wesley Chapel is so far for me, I probably won't be back any time soon. I still have to say I didn't dislike my meal, I just expected more.",2019-03-27 14:15:51

Since I was here with work colleagues, I didn't want to be weird and take pictures. Now I wish I did, because it would have helped me remember the names of all the dishes. I decided I had to update my review, because I mentioned a fish dish and vegetable korma and neither of those exist anymore. Never fear, they still have a great variety of delicious dishes.

We got here at 11:45 a.m. on a Wednesday and there were a couple spots to the left side of the gas station. There isn't a lot of parking, but there isn't a lot of space in the restaurant, so I feel like it evens out. There is parking right in front of the restaurant, but I always just park in the side parking to be on the safe side.

The naan is warm and addicting like always. It is fluffy yet sturdy which I like. They also had lemon rice when I went, which was delicious. I got seconds of that. Beyond that, I'm now avoiding meat so I tried all their vegetarian dishes (which is indicated on the name card). There was a great variety - I had at least four different hot dishes. 

After sampling all the vegetarian options, I opted to get more lemon rice, naan, and a white curry. If you aren't vegetarian, there are chicken dishes. I was surprised there was no other type of meat other than chicken, but since I wouldn't have been able to eat it, it didn't matter to me.

With 20% tip, my meal came out to about $15. Service was quick and they kept our waters filled the whole time.

This is still one of my favorite Indian buffets in the area. Yes, it is weird that it is attached to a gas station, but it is legit.",2019-12-19 21:53:25

The service was ok. I needed a minute or two with the menu. The server gave me like ten.

It's shiny and brand new right now, and obviously meant to go head-to-head with Journey for the higher-priced buffet market.  The theme, at least in the room we were in, was astrological; there was a large image of a bridge of stars and two Chinese mythological figures on one wall, and smaller plaques of the Western zodiac signs around the room.

The waitstaff are of more varied ethnicity than I'm used to at an Asian buffet, friendly, and fast-moving.  Upon arriving at our table we were greeted by a woman with a cart of various soups such as congee (a personal favourite).  There were also a few carts of dim sum items going around.

I feel bad that we weren't hungry enough to do the place justice on this trip.  The food was varied and kept refreshed, and there was a long counter with a wide variety of sushi rolls.  My personal favourite for sheer novelty was what appeared to be kappa uramaki topped with slices of kiwi fruit and a dot of strawberry sauce on each slice!  The buffet items were about what you'd expect; fried items, main dishes, various shellfish, roast meats, salad, pastries, fruit/vegetables, and a large cooler table full of ice cream.

My stars for takeout is the opposite for dine in so I had to go in the middle.  The food on the bar was far from freshly made.  There were 6 in total customers eating in on a Thursday night.  Those in my party (3) felt like we were being stared down by the male owner.  Instead of stairing at customers AND playing on his phone he should have been clearing tables and getting fresh food out on the bar.  If he needed to he could have asked his fine in customers what they were insmtereatinf in having on the bar that was fresh.  As far as unclear tables.....there were four that we could see from our seats and our plates continued to pile up since we continued to try to find good fresh food.  The lady 'owner' kept going to the kitchen and yelling in what we believe to be Chinese.  Did she think her customers could not hear her in the empty restaurant?!?!  Even though I do not speak Chinese I could tell it was an angry voice and she was not happy much less that she was yelling at her kitchen employees..... as everyone could hear her in the dining room. I do not think I will EVER come back here and eat in.  The takeout has ALWAYS been excellent.  There were constant take out orders while we were there which proves my point.  Stick with takeout!!!,2020-02-08 04:23:05

That's how I feel about this place.

Mother's came highly recommended, based off the fact that it was apparently featured on a Travel Channel food show of some sort.  And let me just say...why?

Rant begin:

So I don't mind the line.  The line is not an issue.  Some people may think that a line guarantees quality, but having lived around the LA food scene I can very much guarantee you it does not.  But as lines go, this wasn't a long wait, even if it looks like one.

I don't mind that service was a little weird.  Now no one working here seemed like bad people, but it's a definite culture shock coming from California where service is apparently super friendly and then in NOLA it's just sort of ""I'll help you, but I don't have to like it"".  Nothing for me to get angry at, just a bit of a shift.  But that's still not the problem.

The problem was the Ferdi Special.  I'm going to be here possibly once in my life, I'm going to go for the Ferdi Special because it's at the top of the menu and it is a specialty of Mother's.  Therefore, this is them saying ""This is our best effort, enjoy"".  And...

Who in their right mind looked at ""Au Jus"" and seriously thought ""Hey, you know that runny, wet sauce people like to dip roast beef sandwiches into?  Hear me out, let's puddle it onto the bottom of the plate and let the sandwich just sit in it.  Just let it swim in those juices.  Just let that bread soak it all in and disintegrate before your very eyes.  Because that's what sandwiches were made for.  They were made so you can't pick them up.""  Like I'm all for open faced but sandwiches are literally made to be eaten with hands what is this?!  It's a mess.  It's a mess of salty meat.  Was it good?  No.  Not even close.  I came in wanting a nice hot meal and I get half of a sandwich and it's not very good.  And just so I'm clear, this wasn't a bit of soggy bread.  This bread was full on paste by the time it got to me.  You CAN'T pick it up, it just crumbles into goop.

And part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt and say ""Well maybe they have good gumbo or something"" but this was the specialty at the top of the menu!  If I went to an actual mother's house and said ""Cook me your specialty"" and they're all ""Okay, let me make you some delicious meatloaf"" and the meatloaf comes out and it's made of paper towels and used syringes you don't get a chance to offer me some soup.  You had your shot and squandered it.

I give them two stars because there is still care and hope for this business and obviously someone must like it, and the food wasn't inedible I suppose.  But the Ferdi Special is not the way to go.  Some other reviews might disagree, but they lie.  That's right, I'm calling you out.  You know you're valid opinion?  It's wrong.  You have a wrong opinion.  and your favorite movie isn't very good either.  I'm feeling salty.  It's probably from all the salty meat.",2016-08-01 22:35:06

Their rolls have very little rice, with big cuts of fresh fish - which I absolutely love!

We mostly hung out in the upstairs area and on the roof deck.  The band that was on when we first got there wasn't that great, so we moved to the outdoor area where there was plenty of seating for all of us.
When the next band came on a few hours later, we moved inside.  We purchased jello shots (which were absurdly expensive, but hey... all in the name of a good time).  Since it was late afternoon, all of us were a little hungry, so we ventured to the small food bar in the back corner of the upper floor.  I purchased a BBQ pulled pork sandwich for $12 and it was awful.  It was covered in an overabundance of BBQ sauce. I was starving at that point so I ate it anyway.  Other girls in my party purchased hot dogs ($6) and pretzels ($9) and they were equally disappointed.  

We definitely had a good time.  The second band was great and played lots of good music to dance to.

Just a few notables:
No cover or wait to enter on a Saturday afternoon which was great. 
The bathroom on the upper level was so hot and stuffy... hotter than it was outside ( and it was 90ºF outside).
A lot of the reviews said the staff was not friendly, but we had no such issue.
The food on the upper floor was awful.",2018-06-05 14:21:36

Eggplant, this is what I ordered.  Very good, but it was no foie gras soup.

Gruyere popover is obviously a favorite at the table; crispy yet fluffy on the outside while being warm and cheesy inside.  Not too over powering in flavor but just right.  

Risotto was outstanding.  This was my favorite of the night.  The black truffles mixed with the crispy flake of what I believe is a parm crispy and some sort of squash puree (note i'm totally guessing, i just went to their menu online to confirm but their menu on their website is not up to date).

Meatloaf, mixed reviews, it was good but it wasn't meatloaf.  It was more of a light meatball with foie gras as the binding.  It was a nice take on meatloaf.

Lamb, I'm glad this is what i ordered.  I love lamb. It was very approachable.  The lamb itself was small, but perfectly cooked.  The lamb belly was new to me.  I liked it.  It's different than porkbelly but has all the same characteristics of 'a belly'. 

Gnocchi, very light and fully (as you would expect it to be) we ordered this for the table as we all wanted to try it.  I'd suggest the same to you.

As for drinks, the wine pair is the way to go.  I'd rather not think about what I want to drink.  For the actual wines themself, let me know what you think.

As for cocktails - la vie en rose was outstanding.  I took a picture of it so check it out.  I'd order that again anytime. 

Sbraga is going to be a great great restaurant.  It's new to the market and has lots of eyes watching it.  I think for the four course dinner and wine pairing it is an excellent deal with some quality ingredients and preparation.",2012-01-11 14:30:30

I wanted to love this place since it is a 5-minute walk from my house but sadly I didn't. The view and décor are great, and I love the Mushulu but the deck was a major flop. We sat down at a bar seat and asked a waitress if we could order drinks and a few apps and she went to get us menus. She came back a few minutes later and told us they were no longer serving food on that deck and we would have to sit on the other side. We went to the hostess on the other side of the deck and asked for a table for 4 and she told us it would be one minute. After about 10 more minutes we checked back in with her to see how long it would be to decide if we should get a drink at the bar while we waited, and she again told us one minute. Another hostess then went to seat another table that walked in after us, so we checked in with her about our table and she told us that we weren't on the list. There were about ten open tables, so we were very confused about the wait. Finally, the second hostess came back and walked us to our table but after a few minutes we found out we couldn't order appetizers in this section and that we would need to find a table in the top section. We had asked if we could sit in the top section when we first walked in and were told no so we were all confused. Basically, every single person working at the restaurant except for our waitress seemed like they didn't have a clue.

The restaurant is beautifully appointed, but the three hostesses (yes three) were enough to knock a star off.  We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation, as we tend to do, and I tell them that I know we're early.  Almost every other restaurant hostess has seated us immediately with grace.  These three looked at us and said in a condescending tone, one said, ""it will be closer to your reservation time.""  She told us we could wait in the lounge and she'd come get us.  The lounge was nice, but after waiting nearly an hour - and over half an hour after our reservation, I nicely asked our bartender how long the reservations were running.  She made a phone call, and then snotty hostess number 2 appeared.  This was off-putting, when they said they would come get us.  But our server was absolutely wonderful. She was gracious and noticed as she opened our bottle of wine (fabulous wine list) that the cork was soaked with wine, and immediately replaced it for us, with apologies.  She made the whole evening special.  

The bread is delicious, soft and tender.  The crab cakes were good, not the best I've ever had.  The bean and chorizo soup was just okay.  I had the tenderloins with wine sauce, so tender and delicious, the mashed potatoes were good, and the green beans were fresh and cooked perfectly.  My husband had the Thanksgiving dinner, which he loved.  For dessert, the pecan pie - quite possibly one of the best ones I've had, the right amount of sweet, the crust was flaky with a savory taste.  Oh, and the wine list is wonderful, a little of everything, including our favorite Paso Robles wine.  

Don't be put off by the snotty hostesses, why restaurants have ""pretty"" girls greeting others, I will never know, if you're not going to be nice, pretty doesn't do much.  The food and the rest of the service here was wonderful.",2011-11-25 17:25:01

The 3 story tall driving range is fun for beginners and experts of all ages. Even 4 year olds can play, although maybe not score too many points they enjoy hitting the ball, ha. 

The free to use pool tables are nice on the lower level, and there is even an elevator for those who don't like stairs. The food is priced about right for this type place, and is presented very nicely. 

Once you enter the front doors, they ask if you have been there before, if so you are in their computer system and if not they direct you to new members to sign up. It's about $5 for the membership, and if you lose or choose not to bring your card each time, it's a $1 fee to replace your card each time, ha. 

The lines for new member sign up are long and take about 15-20 minutes to complete. Then you must get into the members line and wait another 15 minutes for them to get to you, and assign you an area to play. So this is a slow process just to get started. Seems like it could be stream lined and made to move must faster. 

Once you get to your assigned playing area there are several golf clubs you can choose from to hit the balls that automatically drop out from your tee off green area. The lounge couches you sit in around a table are very low to the ground, especially for tall or large people people, haha. They're about 1 foot off the floor. The table is decent sized but not really large enough if you have more than 4 plates of food brought out at a time, such as for group orders.

It took our server a while to finally get to us and get our drink orders, then took a while to receive our drinks. Although she was friendly, and nice, service was slow. Then it took a while for her to get our food orders, and took a long time to get our food, as we started with appetizers, which we thought would come out quickly, but they did not.

When our hot wings finally arrived and were quickly dropped off at our table, I realized that we did not have any silverware or any napkins at all. And we all know how fun it is to eat bone-in wings covered in sauce with our fingers without any napkins. So we all had BBQ fingers until our server finally returned and I asked why we didn't have any napkins with our messy finger foods, so several minutes later she returned with napkins and silverware.

Prior to returning with the napkins and silverware, she went ahead and took our main food orders, which after waiting so long for her to return I had forgotten what I even wanted and used my BBQ covered fingers to flip thru the menu and find my order. Then let the server take the BBQ covered menu with her, lol. 

She had also finally dropped off our drinks at this time too, refills were slow to come, so either order extra drinks on your first order, or drink very slow. 

Half of our food came out and we ate it while the rest of our group waited another 10-15 minutes for their food to arrive. how nice to watch others eat, and finish while waiting on your food to arrive. The food was tasty and good sized portions. Just very slow to arrive, and it comes out in random intervals. 

Guess Top Golf thinks since you might stay 2 or 3 hours to play, that they can serve you very, very slowly. To the servers credit the place was pretty busy the day we were there, but still you would think they would have plenty of servers to get people their drinks and food in a timely manner. But you would think wrong, lol.

Usually it isn't too crowded and they have the interior set up with booths and a Japanese-esque counter. I have to say this is one of the best places in the city.

First and foremost the noodles were great and cooked to perfection. The broth for Gates of Hell was flavorful and filled with umami. (Only wish it was spicier, but that's just me) The egg was well marinated. So far the best marinated egg I've tried.
The pork belly melts in your mouth, bursting forth with flavor.

My friend got the vegetable ramen. Presentation is a delight to the eyes. The assorted vegetables melded well with each other and cooked properly. The flavor of the broth is very delicate and light. For some people it might be too light. So for those that eat chicken I would recommend getting the Fried Chicken and add some to the vegetable ramen.

The fried chicken is a dark meat fatty chicken. The crispy shell gives way to a juicy soft chicken that is well balanced and isn't overpowering. Perfect combination with the vegetable ramen.

The Tako-Yaki was alright. The inside was a bit underdone, but still edible. For those that aren't into soft textures or a slight slime like texture I wouldn't recommend it.

Overall the price is reasonable, the food taste as good as it looks, and the setting is relaxing. Defiantly one of the best locations to eat some good ramen to fill you up.",2019-08-18 04:31:30

We shared a Caesar Salad and it is a bit different from the traditional. It is topped with crispy prosciutto and fried capers.

Main course Filet and Flemings Potatoes. I did a shiitake rub with Gorgonzola on my steak. I also loath mushrooms but drying them out and using as a rub is so good. The Flemings potatoes were slightly burnt tonight but burnt cheese is also good cheese. Dessert I got a pecan chocolate pie concoction it was out of this world.

Alright, you got it? that's how I felt. 

Upon walking up to GE it's pretty obvious just how new this place looks. Even though it's situated on a corner in south philly, it really stands out as different from it's counterparts. Walking inside we noticed there was outside seating available but it was like crazy hot so we couldn't do that. When we came in we were greeted by the hostess who informed us there was a 20 minute wait. Seeing as I could barely move, we said that was fine and took to sitting down and waiting in their lovely waiting area. There's a counter you can sit at over here too and it's very nice with cute tiling work. The wait area has two large modern leather couches and some nice light fixtures and I believe hardwood floor.

After a brief wait (less than they speculated) we were seated in the main dining area. The main dining area isn't like life changing its just nice wood tables and chairs, but the windows make the lighting great (although a bit bright for my hang over at the time- sunglasses stayed in place). The waitress was friendly even though I sat debating how my stomach would react to a coffee. And helpful when we had questions. The service area where all the coffee etc comes from has the same nice tiling that the counter top in the other room had which created a nice flow.

I opted for a Short Stack of pancakes with fruit compote and some scrambled eggs. I am not a pancake person, I should let you know that up front. I believe my hang over was what was motivating me for something plain, yet hearty. The pancakes were gorgeous. Like they looked like cake- a real hearty awesome fluffy batter. The fruit compote was also great. The scrambled eggs were a bit dry. but I needed some protein so let's not complain. my friend had south Philly Eggs benedict. pretzel roll. pork loin cut thin. cream cheese. hollandaise sauce. It was simply irresistible. really it was fantastic. and it didn't make me sick- also a big win.

There were a lot of different kinds of people here, which I like to see in a restaurant, families, hipsters, old south philly couples, which to me means the place definitely has draw. I like it a lot, and will definitely be going back in the future.

Let's start with their motto: ""Till the fat salmon sings."" This sushi joint is funny, creative and colorful. The walls are painted yellow, green and orange, but don't worry - it is dimly lit at night for date dinners as well. Although it is probably only 400 square feet, Shinju has a little Tiki Bar (aka: sushi bar covered in palm reeds) and about 10 tables. The walls are lined with a graphic artist's portrayal of dancing, cartoon-like sushi pieces. 

Anything you get here is going to be delectable. And I don't know what everyone's Genji deal is . . . this is a lot better!

To make your choice a lot easier, I have created a menu for you and your loved ones.

Caitlin's Menu:
Beef Gyoza (Japanese dumpling) to start
Rock & Roll (tuna, salmon, cucumber inside; tempura crunch outside)
M & M (marinated beef inside)
Spicy Tuna Crunch (tuna, tempura crunch, cucumber, tobiko)
Green Tea Ice Cream

At this point of the meal you are converted.",2007-02-01 16:06:31

I've experienced delivery to my home, delivery to a local brewery for a birthday party, pickup, and dine-in. I highly recommend delivery!! It is super simple to place your order online or over the phone. The delivery drivers are on top of it and super friendly! It's always a bonus when the driver can find my front door-it's a little confusing on a house-turned-duplex unit. However, every employee that I have interacted with in-store has been unfriendly, unaccommodating, and unknowledgeable about the menu/loyalty program/etc. It honestly seems like they don't even realize that they are supposed to be providing the customer with service. The most recent visit in-store was luckily saved by the owner's genuine apology for our pizza being almost sent out for delivery to our house. He offered to make us anything on the menu for the inconvenience. (We simply requested a ranch.. Ha!)

The drinks were questionable. First off, their water is TERRIBLE. Just don't get a water, trust me. The sweet tea was also pretty bad. I actually had to ask if it was sweetened, because I thought she had mistakenly given me unsweetened tea. Same goes for the mojito of one of our dining companions. There was almost zero sweetness to it. Maybe they're running low and rationing sugar in the back? Idk. 

As for the food, we started with calamari. The flavor was good, but it was quite chewy and over cooked. For my entree, I got the Bimini stuffed grouper. The grouper itself was quite bland. It seemed they relied solely on the sauce for flavor, but there wasn't much sauce to go around. It was stuffed with crab (didn't see any), shrimp (slightly tough and overcooked), and scallops (sadly tiny and chewy). Again, it wasn't bad, but for the price ($24) it should have been MUCH better. My husband said he's had better fish at Red Lobster. The two diners that had salmon, my husband being one of them, said that it was a bit dry. Not bad, but not great. My mother in law, who was the birthday girl, really enjoyed her scallops, so at least there was one solid win in there.

I do like the fact they put several kinds of mustard on some of the sandwiches (as I'm a bit of a mustard freak!).  The portion size here is smaller than you get at most other places so I find it takes at least two po boys to fill me up here.  They also only take cash which makes it very inconvenient.

They have a lot of tables set around the outside so it can be a patio like experience when it is nice outside and then they have a great balcony upstairs to enjoy for private events.  I've always found the bartenders here to be outstanding and they have always delivered extremely rapid service no matter how crowded and crazy the bar is (and this includes insanely crowded times like Running of the Bulls).

Unfortunately once you enter you discover that they have marred the interior with artwork that doesn't really fit the New Orleans soul of the building (the art is mainly drawn from ""contemporary British artists"" who have no connection to New Orleans).  Further disappointment is found in that the focus on everything here is small and limited.   

CellarDoor has an exceptionally small menu with very limited offerings of both food and drink.  Their website describes that, ""CellarDoor is best described by its creators as a conceptual work of art.  Conceptual art, also referred to as 'idea art,' is based on the notion that the idea is more important than the end result."" I must heartily disagree as results are ALL that matter in the real world and only offering 6 beers (one of them non-alcoholic), 4 white wines, 4 red wines etc. is not a good result.  The food menu is also very small and the choices are best described as... ""interesting"" but not always in a good way.  New Orleans is a city of excess and severely limiting my choices with inadequate service does not bring me bliss or create a good end result for my bar or restaurant experience.  

Overall this is yet another attempt at a gastropub, or as CellarDoor describes it ""gastro-lounge,"" and for the most part I've not been a fan of of this new trend in establishments offering small menus of food and drink along with inflated prices and pretentious snack food. This will be a place for those that need their fancy craft cocktails to sip while they eat a tiny snack but it just isn't the type of establishment that I enjoy.  The building is a five star while the food, drink, service and artwork hover around a 1 or 2 for me.  The only New Orleans thing about this place is the building and once you get past that the rest could be anywhere else in the world as it seems to have no connection to New Orleans other than the stage upon which the rest is set.

For those that are fans of places such as Bellocq, Bouligny Tavern and Cure this will definitely be your type of environment.

I do like the building and location so I hope they get out of their initial opening unrealistic dreamland and wake up back to the reality that their results are all we can judge them by.",2014-07-02 13:13:17

The first night we attempted to go, we were greeted by a snobbish hostess who told us that a VERY famous wine guy was going to be there that night with wines from France and Italy and if we weren't on the LIST, then we wouldn't be eating there. First of all, I wasn't on the list, so I didn't need all of that information. Second of all, she could have been a lot friendlier about it. Customer service has been known to SUCK in New Orleans. 

BUT that didn't stop us from going back a couple nights later because we were, indeed, craving some vegetarian options. 

We waited about an hour or so, maybe a bit longer. The place only has about 10 tables and the clientele like to SIT....and sit....long after they've finished their meals. We ended up being seated outside. 

We ordered the Indian lentil pancake, the Armagnac-Soaked Mission Figs and the Notorious Bacon Sundae. I know we got something else, but I can't recall it now. They have an EXTENSIVE cocktail and beer list, but I think I just drank cheap beer for some reason. :/

The figs were REALLY good, but REALLY expensive for what you got. The pancake was interesting, but not quite flavorful enough. The sundae was fantastic....it was actually the reason I wanted to go there in the first place. It is notorious, after all. :)

We headed over there on a very cold Friday evening to celebrate Panda's birthday.  He loves Korean BBQ, which is a quite common way to dine in China as well.  When I say very cold, I mean 'record cold', and just after a snow.  

We arrived to find the parking lot mostly plowed, there was still a lot of snow around, so we kind of rested in the edge of the snow and hoped we wouldn't get stuck.  

The restaurant itself is nicely laid out, you walk in and to your right is a buffet of raw proteins and veggies for you to select, along with rice and soup.  Turn left into the dining room, where there's a variety of tables, each with a grill and a fume intake dangling above from the ceiling. We had called ahead so our tables were set up and ready to go.

I mention the cold here because the restaurant had difficulty keeping their rooms warm.  The staff did their best, setting up mostly ineffective space heaters, however we ended up dining in our coats.  

We ordered mostly the 'standard'  buffet of meats with a couple of 'deluxe' orders that included shrimp and bulgogi.  We selected a good variety of proteins and veggies, which Panda and the NMT eagerly began grilling.  

The food was...nice.  OK.  I missed having some variety in spice and savory.  The chicken came out well and there were thumbs up on the shrimp and squid.  I think they would do well though to install a sauce and spice area in their buffet so people could be creative with flavoring.  Also having butter to grill with also helps with flavor and reduces stickiness on the grill tops.

The staff were really very nice, helpful, and attentive without  being overbearing, even helping us with the cake we brought and served.  They really are an asset to the restaurant, as they made a ho-hum experience into a yay, I'm a fan place.

The great parts: Easy to get to, ample free parking, buffet means you can get what protein you want when you want it rather than having to flag someone down, super attentive staff, and an overall pleasant family atmosphere.

Tacos had meat so greasy they soaked through the shells and honestly made me feel a bit nauseous.  Chicken Chimi was the only cylindrical burrito and it was served with a strange sauce coating it - not quite marinara, not cheese, I don't know it was orange-ish and odd tasting.  It was drowned in that sauce, and even scraping it off left an aftertaste.  

Our server was fantastic, she was very attentive and friendly and made good suggestions.

Murray's has a similar setup, half deli, half restaurant, though the dining area is noticeably smaller than that of Hymie's. The decor is also more retro-20's and 30's with some beautiful stained glass and tin.  Smaller meant that 6 of us could not fit at a booth, so a 2 top table was added to the end of our booth. It also meant that other patrons had to walk in a zig zag pattern to get around us.  

Again, we were a mixed order - some with breakfast, some with lunch.  One everything bagel with lox (seriously?  So not challenging), one mushroom omlette with tomato side, one french toast.  One hot dog, one ""Texas Tommy"" (hot dog stuffed with cheese then wrapped in bacon) and one turkey club.

All were....well, just OK. Bland.  The turkey club was 98% turkey, and so huge it had to be deconstructed to eat, but for all the meat, there really wasn't  a lot of taste to it (and it was ordered with mayo).  Next time they should think about less meat (so jaws do not need to be unhinged to eat) and more flavor.  French toast was also just 'meh', not nearly the flavor you'd expect from challah bread.  Texas Tommy was not loved -bacon was in that chewy not really cooked state that only some love.  Fries were not battered but also lacked any kind of flavor.  If I had to put one word to the meal it would be ""bland"".

One of these palaces was located at Suburban Square, it was the ""Suburban"" movie theater and what was cool about it was that it had a semi-circular lobby and two entrances - one on Coulter and one on St. James Place.

Alas, that age is gone, and one of the early casualties was the Suburban.  It closed in 1979.  It was subsequently a farmer's market, which at first was 'bare bones' and then became more 'upscale'.  Then it became a clothing store.   Now it is the site of a Not Your Average Joe's location.  NYAJ has actually made use of the curving marquee, converting it to a dining patio above street level.  

Why am I telling you all this?  Because the thing I liked most was that the restaurant pays homage of a sort to the history of the building.  One two story wall has the word ""SUBURBAN"" in silver letters near the top and a smooth space where they project movie trailers - everything from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".  This was not something I'd expect a chain to do, and it pleased me.

The Reverend Dr. Steak and I had an enjoyable lunch there.  Unusually, we both chose the meatloaf.  Usually we make an effort to get different items, both so we can sample more of the menu and so we can get a better sense of the offerings for ourselves.  Alas, the spaghetti squash bolognese was not available for lunch that day, and that meatloaf looked so darn good.

It generally did not disappoint, served almost as a sandwich with mashed potato ""Bun"" and fried onion strings.  The sauce - BBQ - was quite tasty.  The dish relies on these elements, as the meat itself is fairly tasteless.  Be warned: Don't order it plain. That would disappoint.  

Service was excellent, attentive, thoughtful and friendly. Price was reasonable. We'll be back, and next time we'll do our best to broaden our choices.",2015-11-09 21:30:29

I think dinner here might be a good deal for someone who just wants to eat a lot of red meat for the price of a good steak dinner elsewhere.

You have your standard vegetarian options - beans, cheese, tortilla or nacho in any combo you can think of, and a couple of other things if I remember right.

Only drawback is the time it takes to get a beer when it's busy.  I'm tempted to order two when ordering as the waiters do not get back that fast.

The garlic knots were below the threshold of garlic I can taste. I really thought they might just have forgotten the garlic or used weak garlic salt at one point.

The pizza was not bad, but unremarkable. The cheese tasted like generic non-pizza cheese, the sauce didn't have any kick, I did like crust but it didn't have flavor, the veggies were there but that was about it. 

I felt like this had all the components of being good but missed out in the quality of the ingredients, or maybe crisping the crust a bit, or throwing oil or something on the crust, or dousing the knots in oil and garlic.

This is probably not a stylistic difference of culinary opinion based on where I was born. I've been to Brooklyn and as a very bad vegetarian subsisted mainly on pizza. Lived in Long Island for a couple of years and had more pizza in the five boroughs than I care to admit. Something was just diminished.

We had the Chana masala appetizer-it was ok, would not highly recommend it and it only comes with a couple small pieces of naan. Nothing to rave about at all, a little bland. (I normally really enjoy Chana masala.)

We decided to split the lamb shank ""Moon under the water"" style curry with 32 spices. The lamb was very good and it was a large piece(definitely enough for two). The sauce was good-not amazing-but good. We decided to get all the extras that you can add to the platters-naan, sauce platter and something else. Not worth the extra $ at all. If you order a platter, don't bother upgrading and adding all the sides they have listed at the bottom of the menu-just order a side of naan.

Dining in is a whole different story.  It seems every time I get dragged in here by some family member or friend something goes wrong.   Sometimes the food is cold. Sometimes the food is wrong.  Sometimes the drinks never get re-filled. Sometimes the silverware is dirty.  Sometimes something is floating in the water.  Sometimes the check never shows up.  Sometimes the waiter disappears.  

My mother and my kids went to IHOP on the 25th of July.  I got dragged along of course and - not surprisingly something went wrong - the bigger story is that surprisingly - everything mentioned in the previous paragraph went wrong!!! WOW!!!!  

The table was sticky.  The food was sub-par.  The drinks never got re-filled.  We tried to find our waiter to rectify the situation but he had disappeared.  My daughters ranch took over 10 minutes to come out.  I had to get different silverware.  The check was late.  

Every time we go to this place it's not even a quarter full.  It just amazes me that the food and service is so consistently poor.

Spicy Pickle is definitely a chain kind of Sandwich shop.  I say this because nothing about the experience or food seemed extraordinary or special.  The parking is fine and they have a decent amount of seating which is nice.  I went on a very busy day and it only got busier.  I had to sit at the bar area which faced the front window sharing it with another patron.

It's a very cute place.  Sharp and modern purple, blue and green decorations and patterns occupy the walls giving it a pretty trendy feel.  I ordered a wrap, pasta salad and an ice tea which all came to just under $10.00.

Once the order was ready a server brought the meal to me, on a glass plate (which seems to be the new norm in a non fast food-esque sandwich joint).   I was a tad irritated when I saw that the pasta salad could not have been larger than one or two very small spoon fulls (and by this I mean maybe 1/4 total) - I don't think I would have paid for a ""side"" of pasta salad if I knew it would total 2 bites.  True to the name the pickle on the side that is included was spicy - I didn't eat the whole thing as I don't so much care for spice on things that shouldn't be spicy.
The wrap was passable but just like any other wrap I've ever had. 

The day I went was a gloomy and grey day - the shades in front of the bar were down so rather than letting any kind of sun or light in the place relied on overhead lighting and I stared at the window shade while I ate rather than outside.  The staff was friendly though.

One final note - upon visiting the bathroom I noticed that opposite the open toilet they have a bulletin board full of business cards as many places do.  I thought at first that this was a smart idea.  People can look at the cards while they *ahem* deal with business......but then I remember that toilets spray bacteria in the air several feet around the area when flushed and decided i would not be taking any of the cards from the board.............I'm not sure how I feel about bathroom bacteria cardboard in my purse........

My first problem is the ordering process...it's a ""serving line"" style where you tell them what you want and they slap it on a tray for you. Here's the problem with that...I was 4 people back once my food was ready. By the time I paid for my food and got to my seat my sausage was cold and my brisket was getting cold, that was disappointing. 

The food...
The sausage had great flavor on it's own so I'm curious how it may have tasted hot. The brisket was excellent, tons of flavor and just the right amount of meat to fat ratio. The brisket was so well prepared that it didn't need any sauce. The burnt ends....very disappointing! The people who have raved about these either have never had REAL burnt ends or I just had a bad batch. Mine were sloppy and dry and almost the consistency of a pulled pork. 

The Sauce..

Not good...actually ruined the taste of the meat for me. Not sure how to describe it but I didn't like anything about it. I didn't try the spicy sauce. 

The sides...

The beans were awesome!!! Chunky, thick sauce and a great flavor profile! Definitely a must have! The sweet potato casserole was very plain almost as if I was eating it straight out of the potato with no add-ons, disappointing.

Sweets...

I was excited to see that they have a sweets bar as well, everything made in house and it all looked amazing! I was excited to see that they had carrot cake because it's one of my favorite desserts. As a carrot cake snob, this was no good...I didn't even finish it. It had a very heavy cinnamon taste, no pineapple, no coconut and I'm not sure what the frosting was but I don't feel like it was a butter cream...which by the way is the ONLY frosting to go on carrot cake. 

As for BBQ joints in the bay there are way better spots. This placed is very overpriced and not worth the hype.",2017-04-16 04:13:44

I like a well made drink, but I cannot stand pretentious restaurants.  I was pleasantly surprised to find almost no pretension and a ton of very well made, well thought out drinks.  

I had two excellent drinks (the Black Lemon Old Fashioned and the Beatnik) and sampled several others.  The ingredients were fresh and you could tell that they were made with care.  They all had something different and interesting to offer.  In fact the drink menu is expansive enough to please just about any booze aficionado.   It would take some serious drinking to try everything on the menu, but I am sure some will try.  

Some of the other reviews have mentioned issues with service, but at our table of 8 the service was prompt, informed and friendly.  The drinks and appetizers also made there way to our table in a very reasonable amount of time.  Overall, our whole group was very impressed with every aspect of Holland House's service and atmosphere.  

The only reason I am withholding a star is because I did not get a chance to sample anything of the main food offerings.  Also, I know it is not out of line with similar places in town, but a $10 cocktail is still a $10 cocktail.  They were very good, but the price can get steep very fast if you are not careful (hint; I was not careful).  

Overall a great addition to East Nashville.  I hope they continue to refine the restaurant and bring some fresh air to the other side of Gallatin Road.",2010-04-30 18:01:56

One thing I forgot to include which is key here was my expectation that the fondue (meaning the cheese and bread) should be the star and that simply wasn't the case here.  It almost felt like an afterthought to the main course, etc. when fondue itself should BE the main course.

Please take this into account if you are reading this review.  The broths, meats, salads, etc. make this more of a mish-mash fondue fusion type place and just not what I was expecting.  Coupled with all the reasons mentioned below is how I arrived at two stars.

We return to your regularly scheduled review.

---END EDIT---

This will sound snobby (and I don't care) but this isn't fondue in the purest sense.  Having travelled to the Fribourg region of Switzerland and had traditional Swiss fondue, a trip to the Melting Pot is kind of a love/hate thing.  More hate than love...haha.

Love: the concept of fondue.  It begs participation, conversation, laughter, etc.  You can talk about the cheese, the bread, what is coming next, etc.  It can be fun, romantic, or any number of adjectives.  A terrific date night place.

Hate: the imposed stuffiness and forced formality.  You can't be in a hurry coming here (which is fine don't get me wrong).  Service was entirely too spotty for the cost.  Waiting 30 minutes for a refill at these prices is not acceptable.  I like being left alone but not at the expense of being ignored.  Serving sizes and amount of cheese, etc. is not commensurate with the cost.  Breads, vegetables, and salads were uninspired.  Dessert was the best part by far and we really liked this.

The decor varies from semi-public to very private with dark woods and paint and a decidely 90s feel.

The kids liked it because it is something different.  But in all honesty, if you do your homework on traditional fondue you can have something much more enjoyable at home for a much lower cost.  I know this isn't the point of going out but the experience and cost of coming here just leave a lot to be desired.",2016-07-26 23:28:18

We celebrated our anniversary here and immediately felt as if we were transported to another world of culinary and service excellence. The staff were highly attentive (the one's who'll fold your napkin if you leave your table for longer than 10 seconds), the decor was beautiful with large windows that overlooked the rittenhouse square. On arrival, we were treated to complimentary glasses of champagne, and multiple rounds of flavorful mid-meal snacks. Our main meal was white asparagus, halibut, rabbit, beef, with a multi-course dessert tasting including frozen coconut, marshmallow on a stick, and decorative cake, and truffle tasting and chocolate desserts to go. My favorite dish was definitely the wild rabbit with fava bean, sauce royale and the smoked sturgeon with chavings of white asparagus. Still have mouth watering memories.

At the end, we ate and were treated like kings and queens. This was a meal that I will never forget in Philadelphia.

I gave it three stars because the food was really...sub par. I came here with a group of friends, who bought a bunch ribs and I decided to try out the fried chicken, which is highly voted on as a must-try item. Prior to this event, my only spicy fried chicken exposure was in RI, in which, while amazing, I thought had much room to be one-upped, especially when I'm in BBQ nation. Unfortunately, the fried chicken was burnt, tasted more of the bread crumbs and was not spicy at all. The ribs, in which many were leftover (uh-oh), were more fatty and chewy and kinda tasteless. The only saving grace is actually the collared green and coleslaw, which were quite refreshing after a few days of constipation-inducing meaty meals during my time in Nashville.

My recommendation is to get the Han Dynasty tasting menu option as it comes with so much food that you'd be waddling your way with the inevitable food coma. Of the menu items, I recommend the dan dan noodles, the twice fried (insert protein here, but I like the fish), and the eggplants. The food that didn't live up to expectation were the pork buns (really dry meat), the rabbit w/peanuts (which was more like peanut with rabbit bones) appetizer, and the dumplings in chili oil (more carbs than protein). The other dishes, like the bak choy and mapu tofu were standard.

One of the main reason why I was disappointed at Han Dynasty was the lack of communication between the staff for large party organizations. I called ahead 1 month in advance to prepare a dinner with specific food and spices request due to individual preferences. When I arrived on that evening, the waiter had no idea of the previous arrangement, and I spent 15 minutes trying to re-order the entire menu and we ended up getting multiple dishes with the wrong level of spices and excessive amount of meat dishes even though we had multiple vegetarians in our group.

I think at the end of the day Han Dynasty isn't bad, but if you're trying to impress a native Chinese foodie, there is much room for improvement.

I attended a work-related dinner at Vivace with a dozen or so of my colleagues. We were a bit early, and our table wasn't set up yet. But we made ourselves comfortable at the bar. No biggee. 

This gave me a chance to take a gander at the decor. Kind of outdated. Kind of what you'd expect from a trying-to-be-fancy Italian restaurant. White linen table cloths, warm golden rod colored walls, and a faded conglomeration of a map of Italy on the back wall. Meh. 

We were seated and immediately brought wine and baskets of warm bread. There were also small dishes of pesto...but none of them had serving spoons. We ordered several appetizers and waited. 

While we waited I noticed that they had assigned TWO waiters to our group, which I thought was great. Too often I've been to big dinners like this that take upwards of 4 hours because we have one poor guy burdened with everything. 

We ordered the antipasti ($15.95)  (they say this feeds 2, but 3 of these were appetizer enough for 13 people). It had some marinated zucchini, prosciutto, a caper/olive tapenade , herbed goat cheese, sauteed & green beans and garlic toast.  I thought it was pretty standard. Nothing really wowed me. The tapenade was salty but SUPER cold. My favorite thing on the platter were the little greenbeans. Delicate, just the right amount of balsamic. Yum. 

The next appetizers to come out were the Fresh Mozzerella over Eggplant ($10.50) and the Stuffed Whole Mushrooms ($8.95). The mushrooms were decent but not up to temperature and still mostly raw. The Mozzerella was amazing, but the eggplant (which was pretty well grilled) was too blackened. Combined with the sweet balsamic, they tasted like roasted marshmallows to me. Yuck. 

I had the Pear/Walnut Wedge salad. Which was pretty hysterical because there was no wedge to be found. In fact I thought they had brought me the wrong one at first. It was just some semi-crispy lettuce. The rest was fine. Nothing special. Double Meh. 

The menu seemed pretty comprehensive. But, I must admit. I come from New York where the Italian restaurants are on every corner. Which naturally makes me a bit biased to Italian fare. But this menu was just kinda meh. I like when I don't have a ton of choices, but the choices I did have didn't wow me. I settled on the Special of the Day - Hawaiian Sea Bass, topped with fresh crab,  with a vegetable/rice medley on the side. 

The rice was cooked fine. It was a bit cheesey, and had some freshly steamed veggies mixed in. It was nothing special and was in dire need of salt. The fish was grilled and the strength of the char flavor overwhelmed the entire dish for me. The fact that it was topped with some steamed crab was an absolute waste because the crab just got lost in the flavor of the char on the fish. And the entire plate was the same texture...mushy, soft, etc. It needed some crunch, or contrasting texture. Maybe the crab could've been mixed with breadcrumbs and parmesan to give a little crisp? Meh. I was underwhelmed and felt like I was eating at the cafeteria of an old folks home. 

WHICH, by the way was another factor. The median age of the patrons was EASILY around 65. It felt stuffy, and old fashioned...and not in a good way. 

Listen, it was FAR from the worst meal I've ever eaten. But it was eons away from the best. I would likely not choose to go back to Vivace on purpose. (i'd go if I had to for work and someone else was paying). It was pretty milk toasty...pretty meh.

The horchata is also oh-so-refreshing --especially on a hot summer day in Tucson.

My least favorite was the fish taco. For me, the amount of mayo kinda ruined it for me.

When we entered, we weren't seated by anyone. I actually left my coworker at the front, went to the restroom, and came back, and no one had still acknowledged her so I flagged someone down (not our waitress)-- I noticed that they didn't apologize about it, but that's not a terribly big deal really. 

Our waitress a sweet, lovely person, but unfortunately she forgot to put in our order. So we ended up having to ask for boxes concurrently with our meals. I know that those things can be a fluke, so I'm not actually factoring that into my score. Accidents happen-- that would be like scoring them poorly because a waiter spilled a water on the table. Not really kind or indicative of what the next experience would be like. 

Unfortunately, the food didn't make up for the gaffe with not getting seated. I ordered the corned beef reuben with brussels sprouts.

The bread was so hard it cut my mouth, so I tried to just eat it like an open sandwich-- fork and knife style, but the Brussels sprouts were dry yet a bit undercooked so the bitter flavor completely overwhelmed the meal. The beef was hard and dry-- about the texture of shredded jerky. :( I describe that sandwich with a heavy heart, people. I get no joy from this. 

I picked the dried meat off the bread and ate just that and the fries-- which I will say the fries were super tasty!

The one heater on the patio served it's purpose, but I did see others get up and go back inside.

My (server recommended) Copper Queen skillet and my wife's omelet took over half an hour to get to the table after we ordered.

The skillet was supposed to be eggs with all kinds of meat and stuff mixed in, on top of hash browns, covered in gravy. Had the menu not said it, I would not have believed there were eggs in there. I just couldn't taste them with all the other stuff. The gravy was good, but not the best I've had. The biscuit they served alongside was fluffy and really good... probably the best thing I had.

We needed to grab some food on our way to run some errands one Sunday morning, so we stopped in to grab a bite.

One of my friends lives nearby and always rants and raves about the place. He recommended getting the eggs benedict, so I wish I had gotten his recommendation first and not after I had already ordered, but I went the omelette route with pork roll and cheese, extra crispy hash browns, and an english muffin, while my fiance got a Belgian waffle with a side of scrambled eggs. Our server was super nice, and offered us great service throughout. My coffee cup was never less than half full the entire meal. The food was up quick, and we devoured it once it came out. Being a Jersey boy, pork roll is always a winner for me, and in an omelette, it is just as good. My one complaint about my breakfast was that the hash browns still werent crispy enough for me. I guess I like them borderline burnt, so it just wasnt quite enough texture for me, but the flavor was good. My fiance's waffle was excellent as well. It had a great crunch on the outside, but was still light and fluffy inside. Adding some butter and syrup created the perfect storm of breakfast goodness. It was an excellent waffle. 

The service is quick, the place is enormous, and the food is delicious. It is one of the best diners I have been to in the area for sure.

My fiance's cousin was visiting from Miami, so we met her and her boyfriend there on a Sunday morning.

I loved the neighboorhood bar feel of the place and the beer selection was amazing. I was also really impressed with their vegan options. However, I wasnt very impressed with the execution of some of the food we ordered. I ordered the tailgate chilaquiles I have had chilaquiles before, but these were less than stellar. The chips had lost some of their crunch and were a bit soggy. I definitely felt like it needed some kind of sauce to pull it all together too. Maybe salsa or a queso sauce would work well with it.  I was extremely disappointed in the bacon and sausage. The bacon was undercooked leaving it limp and chewy and the sausage had no char on it at all as if it wasnt cooked enough either. The eggs and cheese were really great though.

My fiance had the Eggs Bednarik and hers was just ok as well. Again the meat wasnt cooked properly, and the holladaise wasnt special by any means. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the english muffin was tasty. The things that we were most impressed by were the bloody maries and the peanut butter and banana french toast. The bloody maries were very well done and had a nice blast of heat to them. It was a perfect hair of the dog fixer upper for me that morning. The stuffed french toast was sublime. The bread was fantastic and the combination of peanut butter and banana made for heavenly bites. I was so glad we all shared it, but after tasting it, I wish i had ordered it for my breakfast!

Each time, they placed the party on the patio and told us we could snag tables as they open up. Of course, this method resulted in TERRIBLE service (hence the long wait) since servers were confused on who was taking care of who. The manager formally apologized on my second visit with a large party and sent the table appetizers on the house, yet nothing changed. Our first waitress was extremely unprofessional and whenever we asked for help from other wait staff, we were told that they were taking care of other parties so they couldn't help. Understandable but you'd think SOMEONE would find a waiter to solve the issue.

From the start, I knew service here was going to be spotty.   There was a sign outside that clearly stated there were happy hour beer specials on this day.  However, when I asked the clerk at the counter which beers were on special, she said those specials were only for lunch (which if were true, would be in violation of state liquor law).   Fortunately, when she rung up my order, I noticed my beer was in fact discounted.

So, as you may have guessed, at Flamme Burger you order from a counter, get a number, and they bring your food (and beer) to your table.   However, our food came out in waves instead of all at once.   I really would have liked to have my fries (more on those later) when my burger arrived.

As for those fries, they were advertised as truffle parmesan fries.   Now I know they wouldn't use real truffle oil (too expensive), but how about some real parmesan cheese instead of that sawdust that (I believe) doesn't even require refrigeration?

The burger itself was pretty good.   I ordered their namesake burger expecting it to be amazing.   It had good flavor, but it was pretty small for $9.95 (fries not included).

As for the atmosphere, it seems very corporate and sterile.  I know it's supposed to be a ""local"" place (there is only 1 other location in Whitestown). but it just doesn't feel that way.   There are a lot of TVs, which would make one think this is a good place to catch a game, but the way the TVs are mounted results in a lot of obstructed views so I would find another place to cheer my team.

Maybe if I lived in the condos above the restaurant I might visit Flamme Burger a few times per year (for the convenience alone), but there are far too many burger joints that are miles ahead of this place.",2017-01-04 18:39:53

The owners must have spent a fortune renovating the interior.   I barely recognized the place.  The only feature I remember is the big fountain at the entrance and even that was changed significantly.   The whole place is done in kind of a trendy black marble look.

First of all, everything about this place is huge (see my pictures).   In the buffet room, there are no fewer than 8 buffet islands to go along with the buffets that line the walls.

The price is a bargain as well.   $15.99 for dinner?   This completely blows away the competition considering the number of items they have available.

I think the $9.99 Saturday/Sunday brunch (i.e. dim sum) is the best deal.   Dim sum in Indianapolis has a sad and sordid history.   Traditional dim sum (the kind with rolling carts that pass by your table) just doesn't seem to be able to survive in this town.   The alternative that has managed to hang on is ordering a la carte.    Formosa manages to up the ante by offering a buffet version.   There are about a dozen hot/cold items to choose from.

Formosa Seafood Buffet really lives up to the ""seafood"" part of its name.   There are several grilled fish and shrimp dishes.   There is a large sushi bar in the back with nigiri, maki, and sashimi.   They also have crawfish, squid, and several other seafood dishes that are too numerous to remember.

As in most Chinese buffets now, there is a Mongolian grill on the right side where you can choose your ingredients and have someone cook it for you on the flattop.

A nice addition in the back is the noodle soup bar.   Pick your ingredients (shrimp, onions, fish balls, napa cabbage, etc.), your noodle (pho or ramen) and your broth (beef or chicken).  Then someone cooks it for you.   Yum.

There is a huge room on the right side which can be reserved for large parties/wedding receptions, etc.   In addition, there are 3 ""VIP Rooms"" on the left side which can be reserved for smaller functions.   There is no additional charge to use these rooms.  Simply call ahead and let the restaurant know how many people will be attending.   They will simply charge you the normal buffet price based on the number of guests.",2013-05-20 12:26:31

I have never been anywhere where they charged a high price for liquor and then charged extra for a basic mixer.

The portions are also relatively small, but none of these details would bother me if the food itself was mind blowing, but it was not.

VIBE:  The interior is pleasant enough for kitschy old-style-American-idea of Chinese décor.  Although it won't win any sparkle clean awards, it was passable.  Appreciated there were tables and booths for seating; we choose the latter.  

MENU & FOOD:  Extensive menu  full of standard American idea of Chinese food like beef broccoli or sweet and sour this-or-that and Mongolian whatsit so if those kind of choices are your Chinese food thing you'll find lots to consider.  If you like ""combo plates"" they offer those here too at certain times of day including lunch hour.  Food quality was ""B-minus-ish"".  Generous serving sizes but  we didn't ask for a to-go box for remainder for what its' worth. 

SERVICE:  The server was solo at our lunch time visit and while there were few diners, maybe just five, service was very slow...for water, for tea, for order taking, for food to table, for follow up on check and so on.  Not unfriendly, just not efficient. 

TAKE OUT - NO DELIVERY:  Several people came in for take out while we were there, most seemed like regulars based on the greeting received, and all talked about how they wished delivery were an option while they waited on their food.  This was obviously a discussion had with the server...who also manned the take out desk...before.  She said she too wished they would deliver, but the owners will not do that ever.

PARKING:  Small private lot in front shared with other businesses but always seems to have space available.  Like many parking lots in Eagle, even ones constructed well after ADA rules like this one, the accessible parking (AKA ADA) is laid out incorrectly. That is the strip mall owner's issue not the restaurant's.

The kitchen also looked overwhelmed with 2 chefs initially, a 3rd jumping in and a guy who was in a dress shirt (probably a manager) jumping into help. 

Lets start with my honeys drink, we saw a picture for a fancy bloody mary with bacon and shrimp (the works, etc.) we ordered one and confirmed with our waitress it would bring everything pictured. It did not. In fact 3 others ordered bloody marys afterwards and it got worst- they came with no ice- we had to ask for a cup of ice which didn't help it was like room temperature tomato soup. Third time has to be the charm right? No! Honey asked about the picture bloody mary (again) and this time were informed its an upgrade- he ordered it. This drink took forever to come- turns out they had to cook the bacon- despite the fact there was tons of bacon in almost every other dish ordered which had been served at this point (he ordered his second bloody mary at the same time he ordered his food). The shrimp was disgusting we both spit it out and the bacon was a sad little piece. On to the food, I got chicken and waffles- chicken was okay but the waffles were pancakes cooked in a waffle maker, this was confirmed when i sampled my honeys dish which was the pancakes, they were horrible! How do you mess up pancakes? There were a lot of let overs. I did not get pre meal photos since it took forever to get our food and we were starving. 

Finally our checks took about 30-40 mins to get from the time we asked for them. The manager was close by and seemed unbothered. The benefit to eating here was that we did the eat and play so we got $15 game cards with our food, unfortunately everything took so long that most of our party was unable to use their free game cards.

Finally I will mention that one of the individuals in our party found it very unfair that all these issues affected someones birthday so she addressed it with the manager, anyhow this resulted in our remaining party (about 6 people) getting a round of shots (or sugar water?).

Glad we did, because the waitress we had outside wouldn't give us separate checks, while the new waitress we had inside was happy to.

Raw oysters were huge and fresh, but they didn't come with crackers and I forgot to ask. I was just grateful to receive them at all after a 30 minute wait.

Wedge salad was terrific. When I ordered it, the waitress said ""It's $1 more than what's on the menu; they just haven't changed the menu."" I'm glad she told me, but isn't it the restaurant's responsibility to keep the menu updated? Seems lazy and cheap to me. 

Chargrilled oysters were the WORST I have ever had in my life. Small, hard, dry as a bone, not a drop of butter or olive oil to dip the French bread in. Simply awful! I ate one of someone else's order, or else this would have been the second dish I ever sent back to the kitchen in my entire life.

Such a creative mix of flavors that went together perfectly: brussel sprouts, pumpkin, pomegranate and jalapeno. Can't wait to go back just for that dish!

(Note - this was listed under ""salads"" so I thought it was a cold salad. It's not, it's a full, hot, plate. It would be good if they could offer a half portion as a side dish.)

The masa cake was unbelievable, I've never had anything like it. It was like a cross between custard and tres leches. I loved the citrus garnish and also the little scoop of sorbet served with it.

The pork belly tacos were just okay. They did not have enough filling and seemed very skimpy. Surprised that it didn't have cabbage or slaw in the taco to give it some volume. Was just a tortilla with a small smear of filling.

I also got the horchata cocktail. It was very strong, which some people may like, but I was expecting it to have a stronger flavor of horchata.

My friend had queso fundido and the goat tacos, which she said were fabulous.

The complimentary chips and salsa were okay.

I would crave cutting into a juicy steak with those big steak knives.  But as I get older and have a greater appreciation for my money, I am just not as impressed with these steak places for the amount of money that is spent.
I use to go to S&W in NYC and enjoyed my meals there; probably because it was paid by my work.  I just had dinner here with my wife at her company party.

We were served Beef Wellington, crabcake, lobster on a cracker, caprese and chicken canapes.  All were very tasty.  
For the main meal, I had the Wollensky salad, filet mignon with side servings of mash potatoes and broccoli.  The salad was very tasty, the steak was succulent and the mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery.  The broccoli was steamed - enough said for that.  
For dessert, I had the cheesecake.  I usually don't eat dessert (but it's Christmas time) and the cake was velvety and melted in your mouth - yum.

The service for the party was actually pretty good.  They were attentive filling drinks and served us quickly and politely.

So the question is, ""Is it worth the money?""  For a free meal, hell yeah.
When you price out the salad, filet, sides and dessert for $70 (no drinks or apps) plus tip and tax - that is why I give it 3 stars.  It was good, but not great for the money (unless you have it coming out your butt).",2011-12-21 02:04:32

My wife had the carrot cake and she said it was good.
I know I've been reading rave reviews and this was the second time I've eaten here.  I know there is a lot of ""buzz"" around this place; but for the money, I won't be rushing back.
Also, on this Saturday evening, I think there was a live singer in the bar and she was bad.  Also, it's very loud.  I was sitting very close to my wife and I could hardly hear her.

My party and I went to HopCat because of the many advertisements around town for their patio. That was the first issue we had - when we arrived, we asked to be seated on the patio and the hostess told us in somewhat of a snarky manner that it was closed - as if we should have known. It rained earlier in the day, but the forecast wasn't calling for any more so I'm not sure what was up with that. 

Anyway, we sat inside and checked out some menus and the surroundings. A nice interior, lots of wood details and some cute decor. The beverage menu was extensive, although they were out of a few options which they use a stamp to convey. 

As we were looking, a server approached us and aggressively told us that we weren't supposed to have cupcakes in the restaurant (there were 3 cupcakes, it was for my friend's birthday) and that we were lucky to even have brought them inside, but that we definitely were not allowed to eat them. We didn't really know what to say because the manner in which we were approached was so brash and again, were spoken to as if we should have known better. I have brought in cakes and cupcakes to restaurants for birthdays many, many times and have never heard this rule before. So her husband asked the lady if we could at least light a candle in one of the cupcakes to take a birthday photo. At first she replied no and then said she'd have to talk to a manager about that because it wouldn't be allowed either, followed by saying that she might be okay with it as long as her manager doesn't see it happen.

A little rattled, we decided to stay and check out the food - we heard about their french fries being nationally ranked by the Food Network. Our actual server was polite and friendly. He got us samples of drinks and worked quickly. We did try the Cosmik fries - they were pretty good, beer battered with pepper and other seasonings with a cheese sauce on the side - but I don't know about living up to the hype (I actually like Schlafly Bottleworks' fries better). Food was fine but a little expensive for the typical bar food that it was. Portions seemed rather small.

So we chose HopCat out of the million places in STL to celebrate my friend's birthday and were pretty disappointed, I do not think any of us will return.",2019-08-20 22:43:54

I kept looking around at the velvet paisley wallpaper, ornate lighting fixtures, beveled mirrors, and all of the twinkling candles! There were so very many! Oh, and of course you will get your fill of photos of that blonde bombshell the place is named after too! This place has all the cozy, intimate vibes. Ambiance on point 1,000%. 

We came here with a group of 6 women on a Friday at 7pm. We made reservations but the place was fairly empty when we arrived. After tasting what Bardot had to offer I couldn't imagine why. 

Our oh so adorable and handsome waiter (can't remember his name) was very attentive and extremely helpful while I looked over the menu. I had so many questions regarding ingredients and what he didn't know off the top of his head, he found out immediately for me from the kitchen. They actually made a few dishes especially for me and my veg ways! I mean, they really went above and beyond to cater to my dietary needs as their menu normally isn't very vegan friendly. Vegetarian yes, vegan, no, but don't let that stop you. Simple ask! I indulged in the sprouts, Bardot salad as well as the beets, and some frites which were all made dairy free, just for me!! All were tasty, but I remember the golden beets being exceptionally good. 

All of the ladies in our party enjoyed every dish they had. I'm pretty sure our table ordered and split one of each item on the menu....Charcuterie, lamb burger, wild mushroom risotto, sea bass and coulette steak were a few I remembered. Lost of ""oohing & ahhhing"" from our party. I do notice some changes to the menu. Perhaps they change out a few items seasonally? 

Cocktails were very creative, strong and extremely reasonably priced! I first tasted the 'Lola' which was vodka, cherry, lime, ginger beer and rhubarb bitters. Very good! I then had a 'Little Solider' which was napoleon armagnac, apricot shrub, prosecco, citrus. I would recommend either for a lover of sweeter cocktails, but 'Lola' was a favorite. Man, do I love a cocktail with shrubs and bitters! 

 It's really a sweet little spot on a quaint side street in Northern Liberties. Parking was as you would expect it to be in the area so leave a little time beforehand if you have reservation or just Uber it. 

I kept thinking how much I wanted to bring my husband back as this spot is pretty darn romantic. Perhaps we will try the happy hour one of these days. It's Sun-Fri 5-7pm with $5 bar snacks, $1 off house wine, $1 off well drinks and 1/2 off all beer!

Those two things, however, are probably not that hard to accomplish when there are no customers in the store during dinner time.  I've decided to try this place after driving by several times - what a mistake!  The hamburger is probably the worst hamburger I have ever eaten.  The meat tasted like it was cooked several years ago, frozen, and then reheated in a microwave.  It was dry, hard, lacked a hint of flavor - disgusting.  The bun and veggies seemed ok, but I ordered a burger not farm raised onions.  Why would a new place trying to get new customers have the audacity to serve such travesty is beyond me. My son got a hot dog, which was eatable, but nothing special.  Turkey sandwich wasn't horrible. The bottom line: I wouldn't go back to this place if they paid me.  I am not sure where the few positive reviews are coming from, but I am guessing they are from customers who had a meal  during a time when they actually cooked the meat on a grill and it was served fresh.

So, I know, I must have been crazy to bring my kids to a college sports bar/grill but they said kids were welcome so I figured I would test the theory. Plus, I was armed with a brand new, shiny Groupon that was squarely aimed at satisfying my big burger craving. 

First, the ambience. Let's see, LOUD music reminiscent of a club, check. Multiple flat screens showing most current sports updates, check. How's your lip reading? You'd better be good at it because you can't hear anything from any of them. See previous statement about music.

Next, the service. We were seated immediately (self seating) and the friendly waitress  must have followed us to our table because she popped up instantly to get menus and drink orders. Since I was an Archies virgin, I asked for her recommendation. Teriyaki mushroom burger and onion rings for me and two ""Not so giant"" burgers with fries for the kiddies. Sounded interesting so we went with it. Food was delivered in a decent time, about 10-15 minutes, and was steaming hot! Good start!

The Teriyaki burger was cooked to order and had a nice slice of pineapple on it. Very interesting flavors and it worked okay. I think the sauce masked the flavor of the burger (or lack thereof) but it was excessive. The onion rings were large, somewhat crunchy and not overly greasy but were lacking in flavor. The kids' Not So Giant burgers were just okay. One cool thing about this place is the perpetual 2 for 1 burger prices for UNR students. Great incentive for college students and if I were one, I would probably frequent this place more often. For the regular, working, non-Groupon toting guy that I am, the value was a little less than desired.

Wings sucked so bad. First the blue cheese was horrible. Wings were dry and they weren't the right type to absorb the sauce - hard to explain but not a fan.

He nearly exploded. Again, I was trying to go vegetarian, but it was nearly impossible. The waiter, while sincerely kind, once he finished RAVING about the cuchon de lait (& I told him while it sounded so rich, that I was a vegetarian) looked at me like ""Well what the hell are you doing here then?""

My starter was the fresh fruit parfait with whipped yogurt (sooooo tasty - but man, sweet, sweet, sweet!), followed by the pancakes (not on the menu now, but rather sweet cakes topped with seared pineapple, mango, creme freche, pecans, white chocolate & LOADS of syrup) - they were delicious, truly, but for someone with a minor sweet tooth, it was a lot of sweet!

I arrived about 15 minutes later. One of the staff members told me to wait at one part of the restaurant without acknowledging me, but the woman who took my order immediately realized that I had placed a pick up order and stated she was putting my order together. As she was ringing me up, she told me she included a side of hummus. How nice, I thought. 

I opened my to go container and saw the wrap and a huge portion of a Greek salad. 

When I got home and further inspected my order, there were a ton of onions on the salad. Yes, it was a huge portion for a side, but a lot of onions and not enough potato salad and tomatoes. The tomatoes also did not seem very ripe. It was an okay salad overall, but I've had better and tastier Greek salads. 

I tried the side of hummus because I planned on putting it on my wrap, but it was so bland. I didn't end up having a lot of it. 

The pita wrap was meh. It didn't taste very fresh, but it was grilled. The falafel was somewhat hard and also didn't taste as fresh. It did have good flavor to it, though. I enjoyed the tzatziki thought the flavor was good as well. The tomatoes on the wrap were the same as on the salad - not very fresh.

The salsa was okay; it was thin and was mild to medium. My husband's tacos were very good, according to him. I loved the veggie tostadas. They had a perfect balance of freshness and crispness. It was the best part of the meal. The staff were very friendly and the place is clean and simple. We are glad to have another authentic spot in Pinellas Park and plan to come back soon.",2016-03-27 20:59:02

I have been here when it has been packed and service was faster. It's like all the sushi chef's are in party mode. There are plenty of them but they are not really doing anything. There was one outside leaning on the window smoking with some people and came in and grabbed a bunch of drink cups. No washing hands or really protecting himself from the smoke. Our server seems to be somewhere in space. We have been checked on by some other server that is running her butt off. I have never seen this place like this. This is very disappointing.

On a side note-  It definitely wins for the space and décor-- they did a great job. 
We sat at the bar, and I ordered my favorite Mexican Beer that I LOVE to say they have at the Newark Location, Victoria, but nope not here. 
Then we ask If we could have some of the famous corn nuts that they always make at the Newark Location, nope, we don't do them here. 
Next up, we order the Nachos, because we LOVE the plantains that they use at the Newark Location that makes them different, and like nothing else you can get at other Mexican Restaurants, nope not here. They give you the generic pre-made chips. 
So, we took another look at the menu, but they didn't have either of our favorites from the other location, so we decided to leave and go somewhere else. 
We were very disappointed that this place is so different than the other one.

It reminded me of a wooden cave. Dark and monochromatic. Not attractive. 
My wife  ordered the brisket for lunch with mac and cheese and steamed veggies. I ordered the breakfast burger. My wife's entree came with more bbq sauce on the plate than meat. There were 4 skimpy pieces of brisket. It was hard to determine if the brisket was good because of the amount bbq sauce the.meat was swimming in. The bbq sauce tasted as if it was off the shelf KC's Masterpiece or Kraft.  It should have come on the side so the patron could decide how much or little was appropriate for their taste. The mac and cheese was bland and lacked the taste of cheese. Bad bad bad. 
The burger I ordered was supposed to be done medium. Instead I got a lump of meat charcoal on a roll. The Sous or chef should be  ashamed of themselves for presenting this in the window for service. This is cooking 101.

The bartender was friendly and warned me that they don't use fresh mint, they use their own mint syrup.  

$5 cocktails and a seat to watch a local jazz band play?  Sure, I'll take it!  The drinks were decent, but not worth ordering a second.  They're making their money off of the people who want to sit and listen to the band play.  You can get some great pictures and virtually free entertainment here.

Since I'd had a few cocktails prior to this, I needed water.  I went back up to the bar and asked for a cup of water.  A waitress, who didn't bother looking up from her phone, curtly told me they only serve bottled water.  I think the bartender would've given me the water, if the waitress wasn't there, just judging by the expression on her face.  I asked how much the water was, and again not looking up, the waitress mumbled, ""two dollars.""

Innumerable thanks  to Robert S. for suggesting PJs  - not only do they have benedicts to die for, ALL their food is fantastic! And it comes paired with (hands down) the best waitstaff in all of Reno. You will have a great meal here, guaranteed. 

We were in town for the Balloon Races and thankfully PJs opened extra early just for the event. While the rest of Reno were sleeping off hangovers, PJs was packed with patrons enjoying an early morning breakfast. Even though the place was hopping, we were greeted warmly, seated quickly, and our order was taken immediately and cheerfully. The water and coffee refills never stopped, which was amazing considering how busy our waitress was. I saw a kid at one table knock a huge glass of orange juice onto her, but she took it in stride and with a laugh quickly cleaned it up off the table and herself and kept working hard without missing a beat. Her shirt and pants were completely soaked with sticky juice, but she just kept going with a grin on her face. Impressive! 

Having been up since 4am we were exhausted and starving, but due to packed conditions I thought for sure we'd have quite a wait for our food. To our great surprise (and happiness) our food arrived quickly and steaming hot. Not only were the portions more than generous for the price (you WILL have leftovers) but the food was also incredibly delicious. 

My PJ's Eggs Benedict ($11) were the best I've ever tasted in my life - three huge, perfectly cooked poached eggs atop thick slabs of Candian bacon and tomato, smothered in a bright and lemony out-of-this-world sauce. The waitress explained it isn't like other sauces, having sherry in it, and was I okay with that (I was). You'll really love this version, I promise you! Normally the amount of sauce served is so skimpy I have to ask for extra, but this time there was so much I couldn't even SEE the English muffin!  I am especially grateful to the waitress who suggested adding avocado, as it's not listed on the menu (it's an ""insider's secret"" apparently). It really amped up this already incredible dish; I strongly suggest adding it if you like avocado. To make things even better, the chef somehow managed to add a heaping portion of perfectly cooked red potatoes to the already groaning plate. Oh man were they yummy. 

The hubs had the hugantic breakfast burrito ($11) Stuffed with eggs, cheese and meat, it came mounded over with wonderful salsa, avocado, and was crowned with dollop of sour cream as big as a chihuahua's head. Had the burrito come on the plate alone, it would have been impressive enough, but believe it or not, it was nearly crowded off the plate by a huge pile of red potatoes and onions, which were themselves nestled up against a similarly large portion of refried beans smothered in two types of cheese. I felt like we'd died and gone to Mexico. It was brilliant.

Do yourself, your tastebuds and your wallet a favor. Come to PJs. If it tastes this good to a person half asleep after the 5am Balloon Races, I can only imagine how good it must be to enjoy this magnificent food and service when you're fully awake.",2011-11-07 22:20:04

My mother's salad was just a pile of romaine lettuce, maybe 4 grape tomatoes, another 4-5 croutons, and maybe FIVE little shrimp! All for the low price of $12.00!

Is it because of the food? No.. It was the service pertaining to the food that I was VERY upset about. We order 2 bowls of pho and a rice plate. The order they got wrong was the rice plate. We ordered thit nuong/flame broiled pork, what was brought out was shrimp. When I told the waiter that we didn't order shrimp he didn't even attempt to try to fix the problem. He just told me ""No, you ordered Shrimp"". I told him we did not because the child that is eating the rice plate does not eat shrimp. He walked back to the kitchen and again, ""No you ordered number XX"". I told him maybe the waitress/lady wrote down the wrong number, but it was then obvious that this guy was not going to back down and did not want to take this plate back to the kitchen. My friend didn't want to make a scene at the restaurant and she was already enjoying her bowl of pho, so she basically felt pressured into taking the plate to which her daughter did not eat the shrimp. Water never got refilled and service was non existence after that.

Yes, Yes the pho is still good, but now I'm inclined to try other places before coming back here just solely based on principals (This is why I have issues with old school Asian people's customer service and ethics).",2018-04-27 04:49:26

This place was all-around solid, reasonably tasty, not outlandishly expensive Italian fare.

The food was pretty reasonable. I had the littleneck clam pasta, which was pretty tasty (and $10, from the normal menu). I was with a group so I also stole bites of a few other dishes too.

I was here once right before the I guess dinner rush (although they're not open late enough for dinner, so it could've been the late lunch crowd?). Literally 10-12 people (3-4 separate parties) came in right after we ordered. 

I had the Arista (pork, long hots, broccoli rabe, sharp provolone), and the other two people I was with shared the Daddy Wad (Italian Hoagie, Sweet & Hot Peppers, Sharp provolone, Tomato, Onion, Hot Copa, Pickles & Arugula). This was $9.

This is the only place I know of in the city that includes both broccoli rabe AND long hots without making you pay an extra $2 for the long hots. It was good, but it's certainly not the best pork sandwich in the city. It's the best in the Italian Market (seriously, ignore the tourists and skip George's). I'd place them behind John's (#1) and DiNic's Italian Pulled Pork (#2) in best pork sandwiches, but if you don't have time to travel to them, here's your best best in pork sandwiches.

The ""Daddy Wad"" ($10) wasn't bad compared to the other Italian hoagies we've had.  The arugula and sweet AND hot peppers were a nice touch. I love that they include all these extras free of charge when other sandwich shops usually only include one (sweet peppers, usually) and charge extra for hot peppers, but it's included! 

They're not the best in the city, but they're up there, a great place to stop if you're in the Italian Market, though I wouldn't come to the Italian Market only for here.

The Limerick location has gone through some rough patches over the last couple of years, but have been putting out pretty good pizza lately.  It's an acquired taste with the cornmeal crunch and the sweet sauce on top.  It was a long drive so we usually only get it about every 2 months.  We were thrilled with the closer location and tried it tonight.  We got our usual large with half pepperoni.  The crust was a little thicker than usual, seemed to need a little more time in a hotter oven and lacked the classic cornmeal crunch.  Service was polite, but seemed inexperienced and disorganized.  Hopefully with time they will improve.  The dining room is bland and uninviting.  The pizza for slices under the heat lamp looked pretty gross.  There are thousands of people that grew up with this pizza and crave it.  If they can make it the right way consistently, they will be sitting on a gold mine.

Wasn't busy when we arrived, but started to have a line for seating as we departed. Not impressed overall. Not a likely go-back. We were seated right at the entrance, even though there were several low and high-top tables available near the main attraction of the restaurant - the car bay. Although servers were generally attentive, they seemed more interested in selling me more beer than making sure we had utensils for the dishes ordered. I had a chili bowl and a fajita chicken salad. Common sense is that when the table set-up only includes a knife and fork, you bring a spoon out with soup or chili. Chili was pretty much flavorless and could have been gotten from a can. Not asking for five alarm product here, but it needs to be at least seasoned. Same with the chicken on the salad; I'm sure it was microwaved hours ago and then cut-up because there were no grill marks and it wasn't seasoned at all. It was also cold and rubbery at this point. Chicken should be warm when served on a salad and be seasoned and grilled. Girlfriend's burger was ordered medium rare, but came well done. You could see where cook had cut into the burger several times to check doneness. Sure sign of a cook that doesn't know how to. I would think that would have helped him get it right, but that didn't happen. Fries were of the Sysco catalog variety. Definitely not cut in-house and surely not seasoned there. You usually find this kind in dive bars that serve them with packaged chicken fingers or something. I'm not saying this place is going to be on Restaurant Impossible tomorrow or anything, but if they don't get the food and service shored-up, it'll be curtains for them in 3 years max.

After my visit, i'm sad to say i couldn't help but walk away just a little disappointed. 

Maybe my taste buds have been spoiled by having had the chance to eat ramen at a few memorable places in NYC (ippudo, momofuku ... just to name a few) this one fell a little short in comparison. 

Chashu Ramen - the ramen was very salty. A friend who also was eating with us also considered herself a ""ramen snob"" and has had ramen at numerous spots in California also thought the same. I was totally shocked! The pork pieces in the ramen were huge but a little tough and seemed like it had been cooked a little too long. The noodles were good but what killed it was the salty broth. 

Takoyaki - This was the one dish i was also really excited to have because i dont know of any other places in the bay area that has this authentic Japanese dish. This dish consists of Battered deep fried balls of octopus pieces covered with shaved bonito flakes. Although it came with four pieces, they were very small and the batter just tasted like globs of fried fat.

Karaage appetizer - Deep fried pieces of chicken which pretty much tasted just like that ... deep fried pieces of chicken. nothing out of the ordinary here in taste as it was just flavorless to me even with the mayo like tasting sauce it came with.

Maybe it was just the fact that it was super busy here when we arrived (A Wed's night), the place only had one cook at the time & the waiter was very nice so ill give it a silght pass. this place has a lot of potential and i really hope they do well but for now ill just have to keep on with my ramen search.",2015-01-09 18:14:00

Both times I've been here, I've had the salads and pizza rather than the entrees which are bit pricey at 25 and up. The pizzas are fairly good size, so if you have a moderate appetite two people could order salads (12-15) and share one pizza (about 15), and your meal would be in the range of $45-50 before drinks. 

My one knock on this place would be the wine by the glass selection- for a place that bills itself as a wine bar, I would think they could come up with a better tasting selection.  The wines by the glass are in the range of 11-12, and taste like they are from $12 bottles of wine.  They do have an extensive list if you are willing to buy a bottle, and I think that would be the better way to go here. 

On the other hand, there is a nice selection of beer on tap as well as about two dozen craft beers in bottles.  So I give Jake & Coopers two thumbs up for the beer, pizza and salads.  As a wine bar, though, it doesn't hold  candle to the wine bars in Philly like Tria and Zavino.

Edit:  Apparently the restaurant won a Wine Spectator award, as the manager informed me when he read my review here on Yelp. So, if you are impressed by that, you may want to discount my comments about the disappointing glass pour list.

The staff was very welcoming and very patient. I recommend their sour dipping sauce available at the register. The staff rightly recommended that it would accompany my rice really well.

Before I start this next part of the review, let me just say that all the food far passed my expectations in terms of taste and quality. That being said I was a little disappointed to hear/see that the tables around us getting the Feed Me option received all the same courses we did. While the food was excellent, that fact that we weren't given a ""unique"" menu as we expected was disappointing.

The only thing I'd complain about if I have to is the limited wine menu, but that won't stop me from going back in the future.",2011-05-06 15:52:58

First visit was about 8 years ago, second 2 years ago and then yesterday.   The food has been consistently bland.  I thought I would try it again craving Mexican food in the area and thought maybe it has changed or I just ordered something bland in previous visits. 

This order: chicken taco, chicken burrito, and fish burrito with side of beans and rice.  $30

Very basic chicken taco. Cabbage, chicken, some salsa. 

My side order of beans and rice were both thrown into one small container rather than separately.  I thought they forgot one and realized there were about 4 bites of each mixed in one container. 

Burritos:  black beans, rice, chicken and salsa for chicken burrito. 
Fish burrito same substitute fish instead of chicken. 

Didn't realize that you have to ask and pay extra for cheese?  Figured this out when I brought it home and everyone asked where it was.  

Pros: Atmosphere is inviting inside and out. Good location, though Eclipse pizza which never disappoints and Walden's which is great for breakfast is in the same shopping center. 

Customer service: Decent, fast, fairly friendly but it's apparent the regulars are treated with more interests. 

The bottom line in my opinion?  You can get a better burrito with more flavor and ALL the fixings at Laughing Planet, Super Burrito, and some of the Mexican restaurants on Wells Ave for less than $10 as well with cheese!",2019-07-28 00:54:14

Why aren't you just located in my backyard?

Perhaps, I'm sounding a bit spoiled since you're just located a few miles away, but I put all the blame on you. YES. Indeed. It is your fault that I now have this sense of entitlement that now has me actively campaigning for your 2nd location to be conveniently located behind my loft. 

If you wouldn't have knocked my socks off with your thoughtful and diverse menu which also includes an enticing assortment of dishes that are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free. The fact that the menu clearly denotes which dishes are specific to the dietary needs is much-appreciated added bonus. And, while I can't make this statement about the mass majority of dining spots that I have frequented, I can cross my heart and swear by the statement that ""I've NEVER had an experience that I haven't absolutely loved here."" 

(LOUD THUD)

What was that? Oh, just the sound of the mic being dropped. 
I've enjoyed myself here since they opened their doors  7 months ago - so this 5 star review is quite delayed but well-deserved.

From the Cauliflower Steak, Fideo, and Kale + Quinoa ($10) dishes to their tasty concoction of Plantains ($6) or Beets + Radishes the menu stays innovative with unique flavor mashups. Plus, I haven't even touched on the fact that you're not acquiring debt to enjoy the ""good life"" here. There's no excuse to ingest toxic foods elsewhere when the menu is so affordable here. The 10 After 10 Menu proves my point as you can enjoy some of their signature items for $10 after 10pm. Goodbye, drive-thru. Hello there, Sunchokes and Empanadas.

Ready to chitty chat about libations? 
Yeah, me too. 

The bar program here is solid. If ciders, drafts, or bottles and cans make your world go round, you won't be disappointed. Perhaps, the grape variety is more your bag? I can attest that the the list isn't overbearingly extensive but the consolidated options that they do offer will please your palate. Give their Madeira and Port options a whirl. Wine snob? All good. Bring your own goodies and you'll only have a $15 corkage fee.

NOW, THE COCKTAILS. Oh, the cocktails. 
Vodka, lemon, Casoni 1814, and grapefruit bitters happen to be the ingredients to one of my favorite cocktails in town. Order the ""Don't Mind If I Do""  ($10) and after a couple of these, you'll feel A-OK, my friends. Is Bourbon your BFF? The ""Kentucky Hussy"" ($10) is the way to go. Comprised of Old Forrester 100, lemon, ginger beer, and sugar, you'll feel a bit of the heat but the sugar softens the blow a tad. Admittedly, portion control can be an issue when you pony up to this bar.... better have that Uber app downloaded on your iPhone, yelpers. Bottoms up.

With the recent expansion of the treehouse in the back dining area, it opens up the space a bit more from the cozy 40 seat main dining area. The intimate yet well-designer layout of The Treehouse just adds to the overall charm especially since this property  has been in the Co-Founders family since the roaring 20's and before The Great Depression. The aforementioned treehouse in the back was actually built by the patriarch of the family when this location was used for residential purposes. I also just adore that they also utilized local and regional makers to craft the lighting, tables, seating, and bar areas. And, is it odd that the bathrooms are one of my favorite touches? I won't give it all away but you'll find some unexpected ""Steampunk"" and ""Rock and Roll"" influences in there... a little mischief, never hurt anybody, right?

So, I hope this helps explain why we all need a bit more of The Treehouse in our lives. We certainly aren't asking them to alter the beautiful space and dynamic energy that they already have in place... BUT if this this young restaurant were going to add a secondary location, I just wanted to throw my very own backyard in the hat.

Admittedly, I never thought that yours truly would actually attend the Indy 500 as I have never had a fascination of automotive racing. However, my good friend suggested a few weeks before the event that she'd be heading up to visit with some friends and to take in the race as she was previously employed there so I was a bit intrigued. It's only a 4 hour drive away from Nashville and a nice little weekend away made a bit of sense for me... why not?

Fast forward to now and I am HOOKED on the largest sporting event in the world! I was pleasantly surprised by the great condition of the grounds and great cutomer service that we received throughout the door. From the pit area and Gasoline Alley to the grassy mound on Turn 3, the Speedway does not leave you disappointed!
There is even a museum located on the grounds and many areas to tail-gate before and after the race. I certainly appreciate that this venue allows attendees to bring in their own coolers and food too. I'm a vegan so I brought some healthier alternatives than the track food that was offered but would appreciate if they added a veggie burger to the menu! It's 2012 Indy, let's step up your veggie game, eh?

We were there for about 15 minutes before we got chips and salsa. (No one else came to our table.) After another 10 minutes a table that had been seated quite a while after us had their order taken. I finally got the attention of a server and he came over to take our drink order and queso order. I ordered a margarita and my friend ordered a soft drink. When I got my margarita, it was delicious (The one great thing that I ordered.) The chips didn't quite taste like normal tortilla chips. They were corn with red and green colored chips. I assumed that's why they tasted different (I wasn't a fan, but was starving so ate them.) We were almost done with our chips when we got our queso. It had a nice flavor, but was a little runny. We didn't get to finish it because half of our chips were broken and we never got a refill. My friend ordered a combo meal and she said it was just OK. I ordered Carnitas. (I usually order them at every Mexican restaurant I try.) Normally the pork is shredded, but this time it was in huge chunks. No problem since I can shred it myself. The problem was that each piece of meat was at least half fat. I did eat about half of a taco, but the pork had very little flavor. One plus, the refried beans and rice were very good. A few of our friends told us how great of a place this was. Because of that fantastic Margarita I think I would go back and give it another try.",2021-06-06 17:56:54

You can go to any place in the city (of New Orleans) and get a similar dish with more seafood for a cheaper price with the same quality of taste, if not better. 

1. Seafood platter...is like half the size of most platters I encounter around the city. The fry itself is average. It's just about location.

2. Gumbo. Never been a fan. And this dish is just average.

3. Red beans and rice (as a side dish). Pretty weak in my opinion. Popeyes is better. And what's better than these two? Freakin' Blue Runners (in a can at your local grocery store). Those beans in a can is sicktastic -- so good with just the twist of a can opener.

4. Bread Pudding? Okay. This thing is LEGIT. I ain't a fan of bread pudding but this place does it right. It's like God created this before Adam and Eve took their place. It's like an aphrodisiac in your mouth that even Bacchus fell prey to the ecstasy that lay before him...with its bit of raisins and a hint of rum just massaging the oh-so-goodness in your mouth.

My friend's Beef Bourguignon (burgundy-style beef stew, bacon, pearl onions, mushrooms) was a bit overcooked. The bacon and beef were tough chews. My Duck Confit (duck leg cooked in its own fat, orange sauce) was just okay and cooked a bit too long, too. I've had a better duck confit at Parc and Bistrot La Minette. The side vegetables of puréed potatoes and French green beans (haricot verts) were exceptionally done, however. Oftentimes, chefs cook them a little less than I'd like, making them more raw than cooked. These vegetables were prepared and spiced perfectly. I'm not fond of the Mercer-style bistro plates. I get why they chose them, but it leaves a lot of empty space on my dish. My drink, La Minette (blood orange, vodka, Lillet, soda water), lacked the usually tang of blood orange.

That being said, I'm not a huge ""club"" goer and on a Tuesday night, despite it being pretty easy to grab a table for 8, I'm not huge on the blaring house music (though I will say we were right under the speaker but I can't imagine a full restaurant with the music playing that loud on a packed night). What's great is the staff doesn't take on the club like atmosphere mentality and are very attentive from my personal experience recently. 

We went for my boyfriend's birthday though were were having trouble nailing down exact numbers. Reservations for 10 or more have an 8 point reservation policy and trying to get a call-back to make a res was a little hard, but during the early part of the week, you should be fine sans reservation. 

We had edamame, miso soup, cucumber salad, and a handful of rolls including the spicy tuna, Red Dragon*, and Salmon Zest*. The Salmon Zest (Robert's choice) was okay, the lemon zest added a nice hint of flavor, but I'm not huge on snowcrab, and I don't think we received the spicy ponzu dipping sauce on the side now that I think about it since they all came on one plate. The Red Dragon roll was solid, and I would absolutely order that one again. Sometimes sushi rolls seem a little mushy to me, so the tempura flakes and roe give the spicy tuna (which I already love) extra texture making it easier to enjoy.

I would also suggest the Hawaii 5-O roll with coconut shrimp and cream cheese rolled with mangoes and avocados on the outside. I liked the sweet crunchiness of it, though I only stole one piece from our friends. 

I would go back during the early part of the week since their weekend crowd isn't really my scene, but it wouldn't hurt if they chose a more zen playlist for their less busy days.

The sandwich was pretty good, though when I've got avocado on a sandwich there is very little need for the reduced-fat olive oil mayo, especially as much mayo as I got. The soup was pretty good, with a hint of cinnamon and the little seeds on top like how the fancy places do it. I really enjoyed it, and should've asked for some bread to dip in it. The kettle chips (in a town where Zapp's is king) were meh. 

The portions were perfect and the price was right, so I would say if I was taking out a band of younger people I was paying for and didn't want to go the fast food route, Panera is a pretty great option.

I forced myself to drink it because I didn't want to waste money, but I didn't finish the little glass because it really wasn't good. The chips were good but extremely salty.

No spices, nothing. We didn't finish it or take it home because it just didn't hit the spot. Bummer! On to the entree - I got ""Mayan corn"" on the side instead of saffron rice. The plate came and I dug in to the corn right away. It was frozen corn, not fresh. Had that kind of gummy, distinctive taste of freezer corn. And no flavor! It looked like it had some spice or something on it but I couldn't taste a thing. Ugh. The rice was a little better but not much - I tried my sister's. The quesadillas looked really greasy - and when I cut in, grease poured out. The taste was decent, but again, greasy. I liked the spinach and cheese but that's all I tasted.

However, about 10 minutes later a large group of people arrived and were followed by a constant stream of additional people.  I later found out that a wedding reception was being held in the restaurant around 4:30 and they decided not to close while hosting.  No biggie I said in my head.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get pass it - especially with the large crowd standing so close to our booth that I could join their conversations.... I was rather glad we didn't take the table originally offered to us!

No matter, we were determined to enjoy our food and did our best to ignore.  As we wrapped up, we decided it would be best to box up some leftovers.  Our waitress gladly offered to take care of it for us... then walked OUTSIDE with our food to go around the reception crowd.  Once boxed, the food came back from OUTSIDE to our table.  I won't go to the ""is that even legal or a health code violation"" level, but we certainly won't be eating those leftovers!  When asked, she told us her manager required they not go through the reception crowd and instead recommended they walk OUTSIDE with food.  Hey, its still March here in Philly!

Maybe on another day, Zesty's would have wowed us without these little snafus and earned itself a solid 4 maybe even a low 5 star review.  Instead, I'm left wondering if I should bother to give them another shot...",2013-03-24 19:41:30

The place is beautiful, and the lighting is really spectacular.  There is usually a wait here, so I would recommend getting a reservation if possible  Many times I have gone for work related events, so we do rent out the upstairs.  The upstairs has a bar, however it is a little cramped with more than about 50 people.

Service is on point here.  Everybody is far nice and respectful.  They are also very knowledgeable about the menu.  

Unfortunately the food here is really not that great.  I know it has the iron chef connection, so everybody wants to check it out, but it really isn't that good.  I came here many times before finding other much better sushi places in center city.  I tried multiple different rolls, and nothing really impressed me.  The tuna tartare is different, and something I would try as a first timer.  I have tried many of the rolls, but the ones that seem to come to mind are the tempura roll and the king crab rolls.  These are decent and tasty, but they don't knock my socks off.  

The drinks here are just average, and nothing to write about in a review.

Overall, a solid choice of a restaurant.  This is a place that you can take your visiting friends/family, and they will be happy.  It would not be my go to choice for a casual Friday night sushi dinner.

We opted for large, server tells us it's like getting 2 for 1. GREAT! What arrived were two fish bowl sized margaritas! To boot, they were, $15 EACH. We weren't told of this. Should've been warned. THAT was half our bill.

Now on to food... I noticed a couple if dishes with ""cream sauce"". Unusual for Mexican cuisine. I thought I'd try, I got the Pollo Nogales... Their ""cream sauce"" is merely melted cream cheese with jack cheese incorporated in it. TOO MUCH CHEESE. He had a shrimp fajita style dish...it just lacked....it all just lacked.

Don't get me wrong, the beers were okay. But, after three pretty heavy beers I was in the mood for something a little more forgiving, especially since I'm trying to lose some weight.

Well, the almost devoid of personality bartender did not appreciate my request and pretty much laughed at me telling me they don't sell any beers but their own. Respectable, I guess, but there are defintiely better ways to inform a patron that they're SOL when it comes to wanting a beer that wasn't produced in the back room.

We had a fried appetizer sampler as well, not bad. Pretty much tasted like what you'd get if you bought a box of frozen appetizers from a club store and heated them. Not that that's a bad thing, but I'm sure their specialties lie elsewhere.

Overall, I'd give this place another try. Most of the employees were nice and friendly aside from our second bartender who was either having a bad night or just didn't want to deal with us (we weren't loud or obnoxious or anything.. for the most part).

But we received no info about where they were from, etc. Fried cauliflower is still the yummiest dish we've had here - salty, sweet, crunchy. Shrimp & zucchini skewer was nothing to write home about. 

Our bigger issue was with the service. There were ~3 waitstaff milling about when we arrived (all of whom seemed to get busy later, but having them waiting by the bar was a little strange). And the poor bartender - there's only one! - got caught making ALL of the drinks (including those $5 martinis, which the HH crowd was definitely taking advantage of), serving all the bar patrons (where most people were seated), and expediting. She was clearly spread a bit thin, and that explains why it took 10 minutes to order a second round, but still not a good sign. 

The atmosphere is also a bit... strange. Decor is unusual. But sitting at the bar on the right you get a view of a bunch of coolers and a glimpse at some some prep areas; sitting at the bar on the left you watch the raw bar and kitchen prep.

Reading Terminal is stuffed with cafes, bakeries, and groceries left-and-right. So, it's no small feat for the Dutch Eating Place to be named by me as the top breakfast spot in the market. My decree is anything but arbitrary -- tucked around the corner from Beiler's Bakery, this no-frills eatery cooks up some greasy spoon-esque dishes for just pennies on the dollar. Think blueberry pancakes as big as a dinner plate and a wide selection of breakfast meats fried and served to-order, all for under $5 or less per order. Or, if you have a particular early-morning sweet tooth, go with for the renowned apple dumplings, nearly the size of a softball and served with heavy cream.

The M-shaped bar fills up quickly; anytime after 8:30AM, expect there to be a line. If you're in too much of a hurry to bother with wild waits, then stick with the take-out counter. During my last visit, I opted to skip the wait and ordered a Sausage, Egg, and Cheese on a Kayser Roll to-go. After about 5 minutes, my name was called, and I took my brown paper bag. As I opened my takeout carton, I burned my fingers on the piping hot sandwich. The two large sausage links, cut long-ways, were as flavorful as they were greasy (which, in case you were wondering, they were very). My egg patty was firm without being rubbery or overcooked, and my roll was flakey and buttery. The cheese was somewhat drowned out by the other ingredients, but that may well be a testament to the sausage. Without a doubt, this was a $4.50 well-spent. When I'm in the area for breakfast, the Dutch Eating Place will always be a temptation.",2019-06-17 01:40:31

Dottie's Donuts prides itself on its 100% vegan menu. But with some stellar donut offering throughout Philly, Dottie's has some stiff competition for the title of best. Ordering was a breeze -- just wait in the short queue outside the window. Aiming to pinpoint your order in advance? Beyond Dottie's standard menu, specials items for the day are typically highlighted on Instagram.

My partner and I swung by Dottie's on a weekend morning and opted for an apple fritter, the donut of the day (a Nutella glazed, filled with banana cream), and a Thai iced tea. There wasn't any seating at Dottie's, so we made the short journey to Washington Square to enjoy the weather and our food.
The fritter was enormous, nearly the size of two standard donuts. It was on the dry side -- in fact, it reminded me more of a funnel cake than a donut. The saving grace was the apple-y glaze, which elevated the fritter above an otherwise one-dimensional dessert. The banana-Nutella donut was pleasant enough, but nothing to write home about. I did appreciate that it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet; rather, Dottie's let the banana and Nutella each speak for themselves. As a Thai tea aficionado, I was beyond pleased to find a spot in Society Hill offering it on the reg. However, while the flavors were all there, the drink lost some of its heartiness without any condensed milk.

Overall, despite some rave reviews, I found Dottie's to be surprisingly average -- the donuts reminded me of the $1 Dunkin variety. And at over $10 for our order, I couldn't help but feel a bit ripped off.",2021-05-11 11:38:45

I had heard mixed reviews for Melograno from a variety of sources. Some called it the best Italian BYOB in Philly, while others lambasted it for poor service and subpar food. If anything, all this controversy left me needing to find out the real deal for myself.

Walking into Melograno with my partner for an 8PM Friday reservation, I immediately took notice of the cozy decor. Melograno was lofted with exposed wooden beams overhead,  finished with heavy accent lighting, sliding barn doors, and knick-knacks around the walls (including a motor scooter!).

However, the coziness ended there. To say this restaurant was busy would be an understatement. Pop music playing in the background, which ended up being completely drowned out by how incredibly loud this restaurant is. It took nearly 15 minutes to be seated, despite our table having been ready for that whole time. We were seated next to the front window, with the hostess desk (and therefore a line of people still waiting to be seated) blocking us from any servers. And, to be quite frank, the service was awful. It took another 10 minutes after we were seated for anyone to even greet us at our table. Then, it took over 30 minutes on top of that just to get us water -- hilariously, we received our appetizers before our water! Finally, our ""starter"" bread came with our entrees, a full hour after we had been seated, despite us being promised several times that it was ""on the way.""

And I haven't even begun speaking about the food. We ordered the Calamari Puttanesca, the Polenta with Oyster Mushroom Special, the Pappardelle al Ragú di Cinghiale, and the Squid Ink Fusilli Special. The polenta, although described by our server as being served ""crispy"" was mushy and flavorless, with just a dab of red sauce on top. Any flavor that was in that dish came solely from the oyster mushrooms. The calamari was a bit rubbery, although the stew it was served in was really tasty especially with copious amounts of olives and capers. Onto to pasta dishes, I will say that, for both, the noodles themselves were clearly homemade and well-cooked. However, the fusilli lacking in flavor, even though it was served with a good deal of assorted seafood. Unfortunately, some of the mussels were sandy and inedible. On the other hand, the pappardelle, which had only a tiny scoop of the wild boar ragu, ended up leaving much to be desired. To top it all off, our waiter became defensive at the end of our experience when I told him our meal was only ""okay.""

Overall, I found our meal to be lackluster. In fact, I found myself complimenting the wine (which we BYOB'ed!) more than Melograno itself. In any case, I don't plan on coming back anytime, ever.",2019-02-03 16:20:00

""Have you been to Couch Tomato?"" My partner swears that everyone has been asking her the same questions ever since she began her new job in Manayunk. Promising fresh and local ingredients, Couch Tomato offers an approachable American cafe menu, with an emphasis on artisan pizzas and options for gluten-free and plant-based diets.

The multilevel eatery is split into a takeout counter (the ""Bistro"") on the ground level with dine-in (the ""Cafe"") upstairs. The dining atmosphere leans toward a sophisticated take on rustic. Olive green walls are decorated sparsely with paintings and blown-glass lighting fixtures. Wooden tabletops, chairs, and floors are scattered below chandeliers made of repurposed wagon wheels fitted with incandescent bulbs. The space is decked out with multiple plasma screens.

I arrived for dinner with 2 friends, and we were prompted seated. The extensive menu (with a solid assortment of fairly priced draughts and cans) and wonky ordering system admittedly left us overwhelmed. We ended up opting to split 3 Personal-sized pies between us: the Buffalo Chicken, the Margherita, and the Veggie House Special (featuring feta, shitake, and artichoke). The surfboard-shaped Personals ran surprisingly large, a fair amount of food for a single individual. However, the former two pies tasted like amateur home cooking at best. The buffalo chicken was heavier on the celery than either buffalo or chicken (the house ancho was regrettably subdued), and the margarita pie felt incompletely spiced and one-dimensional. In contrast, the veggie special was quite enjoyable, with artfully rich undertones of garlic and olive oil to complement the cheese and veggies. Yet, for all the pies, the thin crust ran closer to thick and floppy than crispy.

Service was pleasant and appropriately attentive. But at ~$25 for a personal pie and a pint, Couch Tomato charges a bit of a premium for remarkable average eats. Despite its commitment to organic ingredients and reputation a crowd-pleaser, I unfortunately wouldn't go so far as to call Couch Tomato anything beyond forgettable.",2021-06-25 15:56:54

Ended up sitting at a 4 top table and we had 5 people. 3 ppl sitting on a booth and two chairs opposite of us which made no sense. My mom sister and i were a squished so my fiancé asked a server if we could pull a chair at the head of the table which is a lot better than squeezing three people in a space fitted for two people. 

Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. The food was great. It is a little pricey but that comes with the quality of the food you get. Nothing was bland or anything it was all unique to my taste but in a good way. I would be back but if u have a larger party than 3 i would just call and make a reservation so they don't try to play you at the door sayin they have no seats when the place is half empty. 

My only feedback would be that the servers not turn their backs so quickly cus i didn't have a drink for basically 90% of my meal and i couldn't flag him down cus he just zipped around too fast.

Very clean but certain kinks can certainly be taken care of. The staff is obviously untrained and have little knowledge of certain procedures and things on the menu. The staff is confused in general everywhere. Upon arrival we tried to return one ticket and it literally took 20 minutes to figure it out. My sister and I got chicken tacos and fish tacos and I am allergic to mangoes so when the food was delivered I asked is this chicken or fish and he said chicken. I bit into it and it was fish tacos which had the mango salsa on it. Another visit I've had beer spilled on my uggs and we had a server who did not know what a old fashioned was and did not know what whiskey in general was. The experience itself is okay. Seats are great and love he concept of being able to drink and eat but the service could be trained further.

Not gonna lie, at first I thought she meant ""Mizzou,"" which clearly didn't make sense. Who goes to a university to eat? When I learned that she was taking me and a couple others to eat at Mizu Sushi Bar, I was pretty excited! 

The location is great and the atmosphere is very nice. The service was good and super friendly. They also have a giant screen for sports fans, which is also a plus. 

When the food came out, I was very excited. We had an assortment of sushi pieces (tuna, salmon, etc.) as well as some great rolls. I am a huge fan of unagi (eel), and was very pleased with the rolls that had it. We also had the classic Spider roll as well as few others. 

The coolest roll by far is called ""The Imperial Guard,"" which came wrapped in foil that was shaped like a swan and had a fire going underneath it! I know it sounds amazing, and the taste was also just as good as the presentation. It has shrimp tempura, crab meat, avocado on the inside and eel, tobiko (fish eggs) and spicy mayo and special sauce on top. I'd recommend you try it! It could add to the fun if you're out on a date.

All in all, the night was very fun and enjoyable. The atmosphere was nice and the sushi quality was all very good and fresh. With all that in mind, it is definitely a notch above the other sushi places i have tried so far. Go check this place out if you get the chance! Special thanks to my friend for taking us here! 

Extra Tip: I realize that it is a sushi bar, but if you enjoy cooked fish, you have to try their ""himachi,"" which is cooked yellowtail. It was cooked so well and the taste was amazing! It wasn't gamy at all and was so soft. I would even go back just for some more of it!",2010-05-11 04:41:31

 I'd have to say that one thing I really enjoyed about this restaurant is the location and the atmosphere. Lorenzo's is found right in the middle of what seems like a very small-town residential area. It's a predominantly Italian area called The Hill. It was a beautiful day so we ate outside. It was so calm and peaceful, and my friends and I were able to talk without having to worry about any real distractions. 

On to the food! The atmosphere made everything pleasant and the food also was pleasant. Some friends ordered pasta dishes, while I opted for a sausage pizza. It tasted very good, definitely a good pizza. I would say though that it was a bit heavy; after a few slices, it was difficult to fully enjoy the rest. 

I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for those who want a peaceful night on The Hill with some good pizza. I'll have to update again if I ever go back to try their pasta dishes.",2010-04-21 03:07:46

First of all, props on the name. Kinda gives the place an edge, an almost dangerous feel, no? ""Meet me."" ""Where?"" ""At... the Coffee CARTEL!!"" Awesome. 

Anyway, like the first line states, this place is open 24-hours, which is by far the biggest draw. If you're the type of person that needs to have things going around them to study better (I know, sounds counterproductive, but I know many feel this way), this is the place. They have free wi-fi, which isn't bad at all. The toughest part will be nabbing a good study-spot when they're busy. 

Onto the food and drinks. You can't go wrong with ice cream, and the food is okay, but a bit pricey for what you get. But overall, it's still good. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but they have creamer and sugar/splenda, which is enough for me.

Remember, the place doesn't advertise itself as gourmet eats. If you need a place to chill and talk or do some late-into-the-night studying at a place where you can get up and grab a decent cup of Joe, some sweets or a quick bite, then look no further than where?

We stood at the bar and drank, so I cannot speak as to the food here unfortunately.  I did try a little of the dip that everyone was ordering and it was good.  Like a buffalo chicken queso dip of some sort.

In terms of beer selection, they have 8 taps of domestic stuff and a few Irish staples like Guinness and Strongbow.  They also have about 30 or so bottle/can beer selections.  The ambiance is more American bar than it is Irish Pub unfortunately which makes you believe that someone wanted to simply open a bar and then decided to give it a theme later.

The prices, are probably the main reason it lost a star from 4 to 3.  A draft beer was $8!  Are you kidding? I know we are pretty much across the street from Lucas Oil, but give me a break, we aren't at the stadium.  I was pretty unhappy that 3 rounds cost me $56 before tip.

Maru aims to share traditional Japanese culture through their menu. While they have a variety of ramen options ( tonkotsu, shoyu, tantan and miso) they also offer Udon noodles, curry and an array of appetizers. There are several kinks that need to be ironed out for Maru to be a four or five star experience due to factors such as the general confusion people experience in the ordering process. There definitely needs to be more signage around how to order. Perhaps placing a large sign up front with a""how-to"" description.  From a food standpoint, Maru is a four, simply because the timing of your arrival will really dictate the quality of your experience. But the food is good! So keep on reading this review for tips on how to navigate Maru.

-Maru is order at that counter, but a server brings you your food.
-Head up the the front where the appetizer/hot bar is located. That's where the process begins.
-The appetizers bar offers a variety of items such as onigiri, tempura, egg rolls, gyoza, katsu, etc.  As mentioned, if you arrive during a busy time the bar may not be fully stocked. BUT, what they don't tell you is that if there is an item not currently on the bar, you can still order it. They will cook it for you. They are constantly replenishing the bar, so again, it's a timing thing. But all items can be ordered. 
-From the hot bar just grab the items you want. They are all labeled. The next step is the cash register where you can place your order for your noodles or non-appetizer items.
-Before you sit down, head to the toppings bar!
-Also not mentioned anywhere, they do have beer, we just didn't see a drink menu when we were there. They have soft drinks as well as other Japanese softs drinks and tea.

Highlights:
The tantan ramen was our favorite. Spicy, but not overwhelming. Rich broth and just super delicious. The katsu and gyoza were also very good.

The staff at Maru are super friendly and helpful. So, just ask questions if you're unsure on what to order!",2019-04-02 19:18:41

Considering this place is known for their sandiwiches, I probably should have ordered one, but I was in the mood for a salad and I am glad I did! The portions are quite generous too! I ordered the ""That's what she said"" salad and my brother ordered a salad with buffalo chicken on it. Mine was exactly what I was looking for! Grilled chicken with crispy peppered bacon, avocado, hard boiled egg and tomatoes over a huge bed of fresh leafy green. The vinaigrette on the side was perfect. I'm a salad person and often get stumped on where to go when I'm craving one, so I'm happy that I finally gave Bumsted's a try. It was A-Ok for sure. And the price ($9.95) was just right.

Writing that, admitting that out loud, is hard for me. I loved the old Parasol's. I was so thrilled when the whole gang moved over to such a great space. I was so thrilled that New Orleans was getting a real sports bar that wouldn't be full of sweaty underage Tulane students. 

First, the positive: They have finally started to accept credit cards, but it may be too little, too late - though it's worth noting the $1.99 fee at the ATM is respectable.

As a restaurant, it falls flat. As other reviewers have noted, the food was better in the former location, and is now decidedly unremarkable.  Well, at best you can't make remarks. I've tried a few different po boys, the chicken fingers, the boudin balls, and the fries. Except the boudin balls (which were decent), everything was too dry and/or too salty. For the Rose Bowl this year, they went above and beyond, serving bratwurst in honor of the University of Wisconsin - but for some reason the kitchen was wildly understaffed, and it took 30+ minutes just to get a brat in a bun. Disappointing. 

As a sports bar, it is chaotic and has a poor layout. The tables fill very quickly, and most of the standing room is in a narrow corridor between the bar and a counter designed for people standing that divides the room. People arrive early - literally, 3 hours before kickoff - to save seats for large parties, and if you miss out on a seat, or the limited standing room at that dividing bar, you'll be left to uncomfortably stand through the entire evening.  This is because even though the space is enormous, there isn't really anywhere to lean without interfering with someone's table, or without blocking either the bar, the kitchen, the pool table, or the bathroom.

Parasol's was vibrant, and had a community feel with great personality. Tracey's is the opposite - soulless, cold, and uninviting. Do yourself a favor, and watch the game somewhere else.",2011-09-14 02:32:02

We brought two bottes of champagne to drink with our 7 course journey.  Everything that came out was delicious.  My favorite dish was the 3rd couse which was fish (I forgot what kind it was) over pureed potatoes.  The bone marrow course was also good and tasty.  My least favorite was the dessert. It didn't do anything to my taste buds but overall it was a great time. The servers were excellent, the atmosphere was cozy, and I sure will come back again but maybe for a regular dinner not the chefs tasting course.

I'm rarely in Tampa but when we looked for some place unique to grab a bite . We found Mermaid Tavern and drove about 15 minutes away from where we were. 

We came in and figured out that you have to go to the counter to order, they give you a number and you wherever you sit they'll bring you your ordered based on your number. My friend order and then I ordered after a couple behind her.

Her veggie burger was delivered in  about 5 minutes. I ordered fried cheese curds and a salad with goat cheese,  nothing hot on the salad. After about 15 or 20 minutes I asked about my salad and they said it was coming up soon. It ended up taking over 20 minutes to get my salad, by that time my friend was done with her veggie burger. Five minutes later the cheese curds came out.  Over 20 minutes for a salad and cheese curds is a bit excessive especially when it only took 5 minutes for a veggie burger.

As for the food itself, it wasn't anything extrodinary,  it was just ok. The goat cheese was two big medallions on top of the F..Monsanto Salad ,which made it kind of hard to eat. Crumbled goat cheese would have been easier to eat and been distributed throughout salad rather then just on top. The lentil pilaf wasn't seasoned so it didn't do much for the salad in my opinion. In addition the salad was missing two components, the Asian pear and the asparagus. I asked if they were out of asparagus since it wasn't on my salad and they said no, so they just didn't put the items on. I love unique combinations with interesting produce but this salad didn't work for me. Now the cheese curds...the flavor was great , how can you go wrong with fried cheese curds.Well you can if you over cook them, they ended up frying out so I ended up with a big blob of fried cheese :-(

You can taste the quality and the complexity of spices and seasoning in the sauces.  The meats and seafood was done perfectly.  Presentation was nice.  This time though, the many changes did not appeal to us.  Most of the dishes are now tapas and not so well prepared like before.  It looks great, much like previously prepared, but the excellent well balanced taste for those dishes are not the same.  It reminded me of the old Blush and the new Funk Zone Patio.

That probably didn't make any sense, so you've gotta go and see it for yourself. What to order? You can't go wrong with their niu rou tang mien (beef noodle soup). The beef isn't too fatty or too dry, and the soup base is seasoned just right.

But there's a big difference in catering to locals by offering good specials, yummy food and a friendly atmosphere and not putting much effort to impress each patron who walks in the door and is willing to give you some of their hard earned money. I'll give them credit for offering reasonable prices on drinks like $3 domestic bottles and $4 deep Eddy miked drinks.

Coconut shrimp were large but almost flavorless with a odd tasting yogurt based dipping sauce. The one item we did enjoy were to the shrimp tacos.

Located in Fort Washington, Zakes (sometimes listed with an apostrophe) resides on the lower floor of a house at the bottom of a hill.

To quote directly from another review: ""Zakes' salads, sandwiches and soups are all outstanding, but save room for dessert! Many delicious specials to choose from, in addition to a great menu. The only problem here is making a decision. Be prepared to wait for a table around lunchtime..."" Unless you arrive early, you'll have to wait at least 15 minutes to get a table. After noon, the place fills up! You'll get to wait on the patio's couch (!) and appreciate the garden outside at least. The main room can seat a reasonably large party. Look around and you'll see regulars from the surrounding area: residents of Ambler and Fort Washington and droves of worker bees from the nearby industrial parks. On a sunny day the place is cheery and well-lit. On cloudy days, the ceiling lighting is well-arranged and doesn't overwhelm. The walls are decorated with framed photographs thrown about. I can't remember any music playing in the background.

The menu has Italian, Vietnamese, French, Chinese, and English highlights. Daily specials are available at Zakes. I had a bowl Mediterranean tomato soup with orzo. It was lightly flavored with tomato and herbs and had a light, pleasing taste. Chunky bits of orzo added substance to the dish.  The portabello sandwich tasted like pizza and had the consistency of a tomato pie. It was topped with brussel sprouts... I looked forward to taking another bite as soon as I took the first!

The mocha gatteau didn't live up to my expectations. I was disappointed that the mocha was not as strong as I would have liked. The level of the baker's expertise is evident in the clean presentation of the cake. 

Zakes is a comfortable place to go for lunch and a cup of coffee. Next time I go I think I'll get the Saigon salad, summer rolls (with chicken, shrimp) or the bourbon glazed salmon... so many choices...",2007-04-21 18:14:38

I ordered the chicken sliders and first as you can see presentation was an afterthought, even a school lunchroom server wouldn't try to fit 3 sliders onto a small app plate.

I'm happy to report that Blanco actually surprised me.

For starters, my friend and I ordered the guacamole and the ceviche. Let me point out that normally, the guacamole is $9 and the ceviche is $13, and the portions are no larger than the size of like, half a tennis ball. We meticulously made sure to eat during Happy Hour (50% off starters and drinks), but the moment those dishes were placed on the table, my friend and I glanced at each other and both said something to the effect of, ""This would have been NINE DOLLARS? And this THIRTEEN? Whaaat?!"" Either way, the guacamole is all the hype: rich, flavorful, and fresh. The ceviche was untraditionally (? compared to what I've had before) sweet and did not win over my super taster BFF, who was expecting something more conventionally acidic and spicy. However, I thought it was pretty yummy myself (though certainly not $13-for-an-appetizer yummy). The complimentary salsa was also addictive and a favorite of my BFF (RE: super taster).

For the main course, my friend and I told our server we would split a dish of mushroom tacos, which should have come with only 3 tacos. When our food came out and we each had a plate with 2 tacos and what I presume was an extra serving of rice and beans, we again found ourselves looking at each other all, ""Are we gonna be charged for this? We're gonna be charged for this."" Spoiler alert: we weren't charged for it, which was seriously beyond gracious and awesome. Unfortunately, the taco and side of rice and beans were bland and 100% not memorable.

Stumbled upon this place last night after the wait at John and Molly's down the road was too long. Walked inside and there wasn't a host. We stood at the front for a few minutes when a guy with an apron told us to have a seat. We sat at a high top in the bar area. We waited for at least 10 minutes before the same guy brought us menus over and at least another 5 after before we had a server. They advertise on the tables having wine from Iron Plow, but when I asked what they had they did not know and said the bottles were almost empty anyway. 

For entrees we ordered the chicken saltimbocca and the CHICKEN scampi. I emphasize the chicken because, as you can see from the picture, we didn't get chicken. We sent the shrimp back and waited another 10 minutes for the chicken scampi to come out. We also ordered both entrees without tomatoes and sure enough one still had tomatoes. The saltimbocca was okay, but the sauce was sweeter than I like and overloaded with thyme. The scampi sauce was pretty much just terrible both times it came out. 

When we asked for the check the waitress said the shrimp was still on there, but she would adjust the price difference. I gave her my credit card assuming it would be fixed when she returned. Nope. At that point it was not worth the extra dollar or two, I was just over this place and ready to go.

I would love to give 4 1/2 stars but that doesn't seem to be an option... sorry... it's for the atrocious parking situation here, as well as for the very confusing and chaotic set-up of counter sales vs. hostess station. 
Once you're in the parking lot just to figure out that there are no spaces available, the task of getting back out of the lot is incredibly difficult. Between the waiting line that spills into the lot and more incoming vehicles and no way of turning the vehicle around.... this can get quite frustrating. 
The line of counter customers intermingles with the line to the hostess stand, so it takes a bit to figure out which way you are heading. I believe I may have cut in front of somebody, which was not my intention, but in my defense, I was pushed around a bit. I still have no idea which goes where, as there was mostly a ball of people swaying back and forth, I kinda hollered my name and size of party to a friendly lady and thought I would stop by the counter and get something to snack on while I waited or maybe some coffee... this effort was doomed as the people ball spit me out into the parking lot at some point. Oh well... when it was our turn the hostess parted the crowd and safely led us to our table... 
I have to say that my main problem with these up and coming famous and trendy small plates high prices spots is that a lot of them have this snooty attitude...BUT even so Milktooth is now nationally recognized as one of the best restaurants in the US, there is NO attitude here. Service is genuinely friendly and they are doing their best to serve you quickly and educate you about the fancy creations on the menu. 
If you are like me and not sure about some of these odd creations, then you know what I am talking about. You start to read a description and it sounds awesome and all of a sudden there is some sort of ingredient that makes you do a double take and for the life of you, you just cannot imagine why anybody would put this with the rest of the dish, ore you don't even have any idea what that even is.... yet somehow they pull it off and it is delicious... amazing. And even if you don't really care for a dish, you can taste the quality of ingredients used. too bad that every time I identify a favorite they no longer serve it next time I stop by... grrrr.... but if you get a chance to try the donut holes... OMG... so so good... and if they ever bring back that grapefruit with sea salt and honey comb somebody please call me... this visit my faves were the donut holes, the potato ladtke and some sort of lamb pancake thing...",2015-08-25 17:55:44

There's a variety of healthy juice/smoothie options, but I went for the Hipster smoothie of course...banana, chocolate syrup, NUTELLA, milk and graham; need I say more? This BLEW my mind and my taste buds. I would (and will) drive to West Chester just for this.

It has all the trappings of a tourist trap, including name and locale, yet a friend's whose taste buds I trust suggested giving it a try, so ultimately, we found ourselves one late evening at this French Quarter standby.

The dining room is large and filled with small tables, murals depicting historical scenes in muted mustard and sepia tones on most walls.  It is casual and unassuming.  There is courtyard dining but for the evening, we settled into a table in the bright dining room.  Wait staff were friendly and laid-back.  It was also very quiet on a mid-Sunday evening.

Gumbo, as with many other NOLA foods, is as varied as stars in the sky and unlike locals who probably have a personal favorite made at home, I have no baseline.  Belying their name, they appear to offer only two gumbos on their regular menu: seafood okra and chicken andouille.  The latter was better liked by the group, smooth and thin broth, salty with a spiced, layered flavor.  Seafood okra was thicker and slimy, courtesy of okra, with a pleasant enough if mild-mannered seafood flavor, but said seafood not much to be found, and where it was were unrecognizable bits.  The thick crawfish corn soup was filled with vegetables, decent enough but not especially memorable, as was a very ordinary side of smothered turnip greens.  My favorite was the crawfish etouffee; once past the size:price ratio of this very petite side order, it was one of my favorites, tasty with a very rich crawfish flavor, although no actual crawfish since the cup it was in doesn't fit much. 

With only a few gumbos tried in NOLA on two trips, I am of the opinion that I have more to try, although I like gumbo enough that I will continue to try new ones on future trips.  The Gumbo Shop seems like a decent, mid-tier choice for gumbo in the French Quarter if one isn't looking for a refined or innovative version, and very recommendable for the average tourist.  Doubtful for those with a specific gumbo preference.  Since they only serve two gumbos regularly, it should be noted that they offer a full menu of Creole food, with many classic dishes and sides.",2013-02-17 01:53:19

Not talking about streaks either, flat out old dry food stuck to them. One dish has crumbs all over it, like it was used already and not clean?
Obviously they have a faulty dishwasher, but the manager should be checking this. This place isn't cheap, you would expect better quality checks; our bill with tip was over $150.

That's what my neighbor says to her kids when they are putting on airs, and I'm saying it to Turkey and the Wolf. Let's break down why I'm hanging up a 2-star review for this new, chef-y hot spot:

- The space echoes too damn much. 

- I did not enjoy being part of the crowd here. Dude. This wasn't the service industry/eating from our buddies crowd that Turkey and the Wolf seems to want; it was the casual Uptown crowd that can afford to drop the money that they're charging for white-bread sandwiches. 

- Some of the details feel like they're trying too hard. Like some of the animals on sticks were just...obviously over-done. 

- But my biggest, grossest concern is this. The menu has a little paragraph about buying local and making stuff, but they also include this line: ""...but we're also proud to serve the best of what we don't make, like american cheese and m and m's."" Okay. You are naming that you serve American cheese. Got it. I'm down with that because I, too, eat American cheese. So we've got that vibe. Now, I walked up to the counter and ordered myself a ham and cheese sandwich ($11) and asked for it hot. The counter guy looked over his shoulder, got a nod from the kitchen, and turned back to me: ""We don't recommend that."" I'm sorry, what? You don't recommend a classic modification (a) because you are concerned about the purity of a sandwich that comes with canned cranberry sauce on it (b)? Nah. Y'all think you real fancy. And yeah, I got my hot ham sam. And yeah, it was DAMN GOOD. But I'm still pissy that a place that is proud of serving American cheese is too concerned about the purity of their food to make what the customer ordered. 

Goddamn. 

However, there were a few good things:

- The bar program is GREAT. 

- I am sorta fond of the vintage dinette tables they found to round out the space. 

- The food was good, despite my little pissing contest with the kitchen about their ""purity."" 

I'd probably go again, but I'd be grumpy about it.

After a management change, an ownership change, and a complete staff turn-over, Avenue Cafe is looking up. Prices are now posted; the case of baked goods has expanded dramatically; and the tea selection is much wider. 

The customer base for Avenue Cafe is sort of weird, because it's in a really touristy area of St. Charles Ave (sorry, it's called the ""hospitality corridor"") that also has a huge residential population lurking just behind the hotels and restaurants. There is a parade of tourists looking peckish and/or under-caffeinated trickling in with confused looks and pristine athletic socks while social entrepreneur types (ya'll know what I'm talking about: snappy dressers with energy that's through the roof and the newest computer, smart phone, and headphones making 18 million contacts a day) hover quietly near outlets. The atmosphere is usually quietly jovial, although the afternoon/evening workers have much better taste in music. 

As long as cups of tea are large and plentiful, I'll keep popping around the corner for a little pick-me-up on boring days.

He didn't eat much of the pep either as it was just saturated in grease.

Mine was MUCH better.  After I used countless napkins to degrease my pep slice, I actually enjoyed it to an extent.  The flavor of the sauce is quite good and I'm generally not a red sauce fan. The crust was bland and fairly tasteless.

I can't live without the prime rib. Part of me actually thinks I need it to maintain breathing, or is it the rich risotto that keeps blood pumping through my veins? The risotto is rich, nicely seasoned and just begs you to eat more and more. And, when risotto asks nicely, who am I to argue?

Ok, so minor note, on my last visit, the prime rib wasn't fantastic. It was cooked to perfection, but the cut was just not as tender and succulent as it normally is. We came close to closing, so I think maybe this was just the one they had left? Or, more to say, I hope this is the case.  

Ask about the drink specials. They change, and you might find some random deliciousness. On my last visit, I got a bacon bloody mary that knocked my socks off. Our servers have always been incredible too.

Cafe Lift has its own chill feel with an industrial interior, but I'm personally less of a fan of the whole vibe because it just feels a bit cold and stiff given their metal chairs, exterior pipes, plastic water jugs, grey/red color palate, etc. Their tables are also kind of fastened to the ground in rows in a factory-like and rigid manner that makes me feel a bit cramped, even though it's not like a particularly small space. 

Service is pretty good overall, and food isn't bad but I also haven't been wowed. For example, on my most recent visit, I ordered their egg mushroom toast but there were so few mushrooms that it felt like I was just eating egg toast. Also, I've had their famous lemon ricotta pancakes in the past, but in my opinion, those pancakes were too mushy and flat. I know others love how ""moist"" it is, but I think it tastes far too soggy for my ideal pancake. To date, it is still cash only as well.

Explanation:
Two of my friends and I made a day trip to the other side of the river in late summer and in that trip we found ourselves in Alton.  We were starving so I called a friends that was from there and asked him where we should go to eat and he told me to go to Fast Eddie's.  Since then I have put much thought into weather said friend actually likes me because he sent me here.  First off you have to be 21 or older to get in, we are all over the age of 21 but that should have been the signal to not go any further.  We realized that we had to go to the back to order our food which was no big deal. We order the food and went to sit down and then were told by our waitress that we had to order drinks if we wanted to stay, those where her exact words.  We all ordered something, but were really off put by her attitude since we had ordered food.  We got our drinks and waited... and waited... and waited for our food.  We got a burger, a pork skewer and some fries and it took 30 minutes for us to get them!  It was four o'clock in the afternoon on a Thursday, isn't this place called FAST Eddies???  When we finally got our food it was alright, it was very cheap and we defiantly got what we paid for.  Every time our waitress came over to us she made it seem like we were wasting her time because we only needed one drink a piece.  All in all maybe this place in only a bar and my friend is just horrible at giving recommendations for places to eat.  Maybe some day I will go there to drink, but I know of better place that aren't 40 minutes away.",2009-12-18 20:47:24

First Impressions/Appearance:  So when you walk in, the restaurant is very dry and doesn't give you anything to awe at. There is no real pop of red or anything to make this restaurant stand out from any other typical restaurant. The tables are very dark in color, which I typically don't mind but again it was very dry and dull. They seat you at 10 to a table which again I didn't mind, but it is very close and a bit uncomfortable when you're trying to enjoy dinner. 

Customer Service: I am big on customer service and theirs was on point. Their customer service was great. We were seated immediately and the wait staff was great and attentive. Our drinks were filled and they cleared our soup and salad bowls in time so we had more space at the small tables. At the end of our meal, there was another lady that came out to box up our left overs which she did in front of us so that gets an extra star from me. 

The Dinner Show:  our chef was very entertaining. He did all of the tricks, the 'egg roll', flipping the egg in his hat and flipping the shrimp tail in his shirt pocket. That was cool and so was the volcano and making the fire shoot out and up. He cracked jokes and made fun of all the latest commercials playing on the radio. He cooked the vegetables with such precision and made the noodles and rice with so much action. I don't remember noodles and rice being that entertaining, but he made them a real show. His knife techniques were astonishing and the cut of the meat and chicken all the same size. 

The Food:  the soup was ok and full of flavor. It was served hot which was good on a cold night. The salad was fresh and the ginger dressing was delicious, I really could have used more salad. The vegetables were cooked first. We had onions, zucchini, carrots, broccoli, and green beans. I think they were undercooked but I think most people like their veggies a bit more crispy. The onions were very pungent and could have been cooked a little longer along with the carrots and beans. Next came the noodles. Now as o stated earlier, I am not a pasta fan but I do cook it for my family. These noodles were under seasoned and overlooked. They could have used some salt and pepper and should have been a little less than al dente. That way, it can finish cooking on the grill. The rice was next, and it was not cooked, so when the chef went to fry it, it didn't steam enough, so we ended up with hard rice that was greasy and had no flavor. Lastly were the meats. The meat had good flavor and it was cooked well. I had the chicken and steak and both were prepared how I liked. The steak also came with potatoes, which surprisingly were pretty good. 

Rating: So why 3 stars? Simply put, the food could have been better and the establishment could have been nicer. I can spend the same amount and maybe a few dollars more on more food and much better food. I know the idea is a dinner and a show, but I think they need to work on their food more since they have the show down. I don't think I will be going back but glad I decided to give it a try since I have never been and now I have a platform to let others know what to expect.",2016-01-20 02:42:36

The servers at Royal India were prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. They really made the effort to provide good service and seemed keen on making certain that we enjoyed our experience in the restaurant. 

My friend and I spilt several types of Naan Bread - a potato one (I wasn't totally crazy about, but my friend liked) and a very good Cheese Naan. Light, fluffy warm Naan interlaced with gooey cheese - just can't beat it!  My favorite sauce was their Cilantro Chutney - it was very different from normal sauces served at Indian Restaurants, but so light and refreshing with a little zig of spicy flavors. 

I ordered the Chickpea and Potato Curry (Extra Spicy of course) and a Mango Mojito. The Mango Mojito was a basic Mango Mojito, nothing spectacularly unique, but nothing awry - light, refreshing, tasty, sweet mixed drink. I'd order it again. The Chickpea and Potato Curry on the other hand was amazing! I always get annoyed when I order 'super spicy' and get a bland dish because the restaurant was too timid to listen to me - it is always insulting and always a disappointment.  The resulting dish had that warming spiciness that increased in heat with each bite and made your whole throat bask in the heat of spicy goodness! Oh yeah! Let it burn! Let it burn! The potatoes in the dish had been cooked perfectly and the chickpea ratio was generous. I would order this dish again in a heartbeat.  Their complimentary rice was super light and fluffy. 

Other details: Their prices were fair. The restaurant decor was nice and it was clean. Lastly, they have a large Vegetarian / Vegan Section, enough to keep me going back for months with a new dish each time.

Highly recommend!",2018-08-31 16:30:56

Basically they do deals on nachos, drafts, and margaritas, not too shabby. We started off with the guacamole which was actually a good size portion for 2 people and the chips were sturdy enough to be dragged through it. Everything was extremely fresh and it made a difference. For dinner we did a few chicken tacos, a shrimp taco, and a fish burrito. The tortillas here are legit and they hold up while you are eating the tacos/burritos which is really important in my opinion. Everything was great, no complaints at all.

Milk House, a new grilled cheese place in Center City Philly near Rittenhouse Square, was my latest attempt to like one of these places.  But here's the deal in my opinion.  The grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup served here don't really taste any better than those served at a diner or luncheonette.  They just cost a lot more and it's not worth it.  Maybe they use a supposedly better bread ... yes they have different things that can be grilled inside the sandwich .... at an added price of course.  But my guess is these places will ultimately never succeed because who wants to pay the same price for a grilled cheese sandwich as for a hoagie or cheesesteak and not even be filled up.  Everything was decent here ... the quality of the grilled cheese was fine.  But it would have been nice if they had salt and pepper available in case someone likes to add them.

The food to me however is more often only average or just a little bit above. I recently had the French onion soup which was tasty enough but def not hot enough.  The green salad with bleu cheese dressing was standard which was fine.  My main course was a beef & cheese sandwich that was decidedly not something memorable or I would order again.  Where was the cheese? The sweet potato fries lacked crispness and appeared to just have been heated up.  My friend however reported very much enjoying his filet mignon dinner.

I sat at the bar to try some of their bar food.  The carrots asado were tasty and the langos with smoked beets (which is the main reason I stopped by here) was also very well-made.  However both dishes are small and pricey just like at Vedge as well - the Langos is probably a quarter of the size one receives in Vienna or Budapest and is more than twice the price at nine dollars.

We had just been to tastings and had a meat / cheese tray a couple hours prior. So we did not start with an app. 

Husband got a Caesar salad. To me - it was extremely fishy tasting. I love anchovies - but every bite tasted like fish. 

The bread was hard and wasn't flavorful. When do you ever say that about bread? Or stop at just one? The olive oil dipping mixture was so so. 

Meal - we both ordered the filet. Loaded baked potato for the side. We typically wouldn't order a baked potato, but sounded good. Filets were perfect. Not overly seasoned. Cooked perfectly. Great flavor. The potato was cold. And the sides are odd. I know with there being a million steak houses you have to stick out. But if you're going to put sides on the side, put them all on the side. Butter was on the potato. And then the bacon and some mixture with  chives was in the side. Both were not tasty. The bacon i believe was smoked but tasted like bacon bits. Yuck. The chive mixture also was not good. The baked potato presentation by itself was nice. And the size was perfect. But again was cold. They brought another. This time no butter at all. With the same sides. I suggest different sides. More appealing presentation of them also.

The decor is more polished than most strip-mall restaurants, lending an ambiance that says ""date night"" more than ""bring the kids"". They offer delivery service which might help them compete with numerous Asian options in the area, and their mix of Chinese, Thai and Hibachi dishes makes for interesting options.

After being seated, a serving of fried wonton strips was served with (canned) sweet and sour sauce and Chinese hot mustard. The hostess was friendly but we had a pretty severe communication gap with our server. Thankfully, the hostess came back and sorted things out.

My wife and I chose Combination Dinner C (for two or more, $15.99 per person). The meal is served with a choice of entree from a list of eleven options, steamed or fried rice, and one of several soups. The included appetizer plate featured two pieces each of crab rangoon, fried prawns, beef sticks and vegetable egg rolls.

My wife said her hot and sour soup was lacking in vinegar, I felt it needed more heat. My order of wonton soup was better, nothing special but acceptable. The appetizers were pretty good. The beef sticks were skewers of marinated, tender flank steak served with teriyaki sauce. Butterflied prawns were breaded and crispy, as were fried triangles of wonton wrapper and cheese. Unfortunately, the vegetables inside the egg rolls were undercooked and stringy, making it nearly impossible to bite through without leaving the contents all over the plate.

My wife's Hibachi Triple Delight entree was quite good, with a mix of veggies, chicken and scallop in a savory,  slightly-spicy sauce. The veggies were cooked with with just a bit of crunch, no complaints about the meat. Quite tender and tasty.

My choice of Black Pepper Delicacy was less successful. A shallow dish of diced bell pepper and onion in a dark gravy comprised the ""black pepper sauce"", perhaps so-named for its color. I certainly couldn't detect any peppercorn in this condiment served with battered shrimp, scallops, and ""crab"" (obviously surimi, aka, krab-with-a-K). The batter was similar to tempura, though lacking in crunch or flavor. I dunked the first couple pieces in gravy trying to appreciate it as-is, but eventually gave up and freed the seafood from its dense, spongy cocoon. Though I don't mind surimi per se, I'd really love it if all restaurants--I'm looking at you, AYCE sushi--would identify it as such instead of calling it crab. The surimi had become one with the batter, so that was that.

Our dining companions chose to order single entrees, which meant I got to try a couple more entrees. A dish of Singapore rice noodles was agreed to be everyone's favorite ($9.99), a bed of thin vermicelli supporting chicken, shrimp, bean sprouts, onion, and scallion in a spicy curry sauce redolent of Chinese Five Spice blend. An order of teriyaki New York strip steak rounded out the meal with chunks of medium rare beef and al dente veggies ($15.99).

Though our overall meal was pleasant, there were service snafus throughout. The wrong soup was delivered (then replaced) and everyone's entree arrived with considerable time gaps in between. Last to the table was a mistake plate of some chicken dish rather than the steak, so more time was lost waiting for its replacement. When the correct plate finally arrived the vegetables were nice and hot, but the beef was barely warm. There were plenty of good flavors to be enjoyed, but the staff have a lot to learn about timing. My order of hot sake ($5.99, lg) didn't arrive until after the appetizers and one of the entrees. Chin Chin has only been open a few weeks, so hopefully it'll find its path up that hill.",2015-05-28 15:46:54

The chips are crisp and the salsa is chunky. I would describe the salsa on the roasted tomato side, it looks kind of dark. I did not care for it much, but I am picky about Mexican.

The guacamole was fresh and not overpowering. I think it was a bit less doctored up then I prefer but it was still good.

The carne asada tacos lunch special I ordered was skimpy. The large plate arrived with two small flour tortillas with a little bit of Carne Asada chunks on each one. The plate also included a cabbage and pepper garnish as well as a bowl that had half black beans and half Spanish rice in it. The beans/rice tasted fresh but very boring, would not order on purpose.

They sell a starter which is a quesadilla with chorizo and potato in it and those are very tasty, but the portions are small.

I guess that was my fault.

As for the pizzas, we ordered the Portofino, the Tucci, The Ultimate Bertucci (dun dun duuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!), and the Pucillo.  Check the website for toppings on those and others; there really is something for everyone.

I was craving  a fried roll so I ordered a Vegas roll and the roll tasted as it had been fried way before I ordered it. The batter was also very thin and didn't add much to the taste, which defeats the whole purpose of a fried roll. Even worse, the roll had a strong fishy smell. So gross. The two other rolls we had throughout the evening were just okay. 

Thinking that maybe the food would be better, we tried the chicken skewers. I was dead wrong. The chicken was so rubbery and had a very strange gamey taste. 

It's also annoying that their drink specials are more expensive that full-price drinks elsewhere. They do have 2 dollar sake which is nice.

The service was very good, but our waiter OVERSOLD everything.  It was all so ""fabulous...tasty...excellent...savory..the best...""  you get the picture.  It was exhausting just listening to him describe the menu items.
Started with a cheese plate..nice presentation, cheese was room temperature (which was good) and a good selection of cracker/breads to go with it.  To call that stuff bacon jam was a stretch.  There was not smoky or fatty flavor you would expect from something called ""bacon jam"".  It could have been fig jam or raisin jam and it would have tasted as described.
Also started with crab cakes---too much rosemary and not much crab.  Served with some sweet sauce and a vinegar slaw.  Not a winner at the table.
Had to have the fried green tomatoes---same sweet sauce as the crab cakes and thick slices of tomatoes that tasted raw and under-ripe. Swing and a miss.
Dinner entrees included:
Chicken fried chicken on a bed of yukon gold mashed potatoes and a  puddle of brown demi-glace.  I like my white peppery gravy on my chicken fried anything, so this was different but not good.  The chicken was huge, but not much flavor.  The potatoes were lukewarm at best.

The small filet was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.

The meatloaf was not nearly as tasty as it had been predicted to be.  The texture was rather strange, also. It was pasty and had the texture of liver spread.

Macaroni and cheese---not cheesy enough and the addition of ham didn't do it for us.

Brussel sprouts could have been cooked a little longer and seasoned with some of the missing bacon from the jam.

Dessert..hhhmm
The Elvis thing---imagine something like a pumpkin pie but made with bananas instead (not all the cinnamon, allspice  and sugar) baked in a crust that wasn't quite done. Slice it onto a plate with some good peanut butter ice cream and sprinkle some HARD pieces of peanut brittle.   You know you want to try it, don't you?  But I doubt you'll finish it.

The fried peach pie---deconstructed.  So on the plate you get some pieces of paper thin pie crust  (and those are quite good), An unpeeled peach that, I think, was poached and sliced, and then sprinkled with some sugar and cinnamon, and a scoop of yummy butter pecan ice cream.

I went here for a late lunch on a Sunday.  The waitstaff was friendly and prompt.  As a vegetarian, I really enjoyed having a whole menu to choose from, not just a few boring vegetarian dishes.  I'm not a big fake meat eater, but I've always wanted to try a Cuban sandwich so I got the veggie version- which was delicious.  We got fried beets with aioli to share, which were my favorite part- perfectly cooked and crispy.  My friend, a meat eater, got a sweet potato scramble with fried eggs that she really enjoyed.

It also works like a Chinese restaurant anywhere else... if you don't see it on the menu, ask if they have ingredients, and then the chef will throw something you might like together. For example, I always ask them what type of fresh vegetables they have, and often just have the chef toss the veggies with some garlic and oil and spices and have it as a side dish.

I often come here for the dan dan noodles. I think they probably have the best dan dan noodles in town. It's spicy, sour, and chewy like they're supposed to be. 

Since Four Rivers is a Szechuan style restaurant, you can expect a lot of the food to be very spicy. Bring tissues and napkins as you will be sweating, your nose will be running, your eyes tearing, whether in happiness or in pain. 

The mapo tofu here is also done well, a little too well, and I prefer it to not be so spicy. Unfortunately even asking for less spicy here is a little too spicy for me... but hey, that's what you expect at a Szechuan restaurant right?

The scallion pancake here is traditional and very good. Try this place if you want something authentic, and again, if you don't see what you want, ask if they have it... who knows... you might end up getting what you want.",2012-02-06 23:50:20

When you enter the store you walk to the far rear left corner to find the restaurant.   It's a lot larger space than I imagined and very colorfully decorated.   Despite the fact it was 230p, there were several tables of patrons.  I took this as a sign the food was good!  I was seated promptly, and my waitress arrived in just a couple of minutes. I ordered water to drink as well as one of the daily specials (huevos con verde).   Upon being seated I was served with tortilla chips and two different salads, a roja and verde style. They were both very tasty and spicy hot just as I like them!  
My entree arrived in record time...seriously it took maybe five minutes!  The eggs were served with rice, refried beans and corn tortillas.  Again, spice level was hot, but I prefer this so it was a non-issue for me.  I expected the eggs to be served huevos rancheros style, but they were fried and sort of chopped up in the verde sauce. I enjoyed the dish, despite not being exactly what I expected.
CG also offers a full bar with seating, as well as a bar menu at your table, if you're interested.  The restaurant is very large and could hold a crowd if necessary.

I was pretty disappointed when I left, and two stars is actually a pretty decent review after pit experience. My fiancé and I bought a groupon and when making a reservation made sure to note that we were using a groupon. We walked in to a near empty dining room- only one table was occupied- and told them we had a reservation. Which we realized at the end of the meal they never looked at in the computer, when they wouldn't let us use the groupon. 

The atmosphere was okay- small dining room, pleasant with a busy and smiley but slightly snippy waitress. We ordered- I got a soup and salad and he got the quiche of the day and a salad. The prices are totally outrageous. $29 for an omelet. $11 for soup. It's crazy! Also- The prices are way higher than on their website menu. So it was more than we had anticipated after looking at their website online. The food itself was just okay. Underseasoned, not quite hot just lukewarm. The salad dressing had no flavor. My fiancé said the quiche was mushy and had a strong and off putting shrimpy taste. Most certainly not worth the prices. 

At the end of the meal, we were told we could not use the grouping bc we did not order 2 entrees as the fine print stated. And that we should have told the waitress we had it so she could tell us how to order. My fiancé tried to explain that we put it in the reservation (we assumed they would look at the reservation in the computer when seating us). The waitress laughed in his face and said ""Oh please! I'm not the one who took your reservation!"" Wow. That wasn't at all what he was saying, if she had taken a moment to try and listen. We were stunned.

The Bad:  How high brow are you to charge $3 for valet parking?  This is the only place in Nashville that I've ever seen that done.  $12 bucks for a bread basket?   How good is the bread?  Isn't bread one of the cheapest things in a restaurant?   The rest of the meal  (fish and chicken for the table) was over salted and underwhelming.  

The tables themselves felt cheap and more like something you'd find at Ashely Home Furnishings.  I'd expect more if dropping well over $200 on a meal for 4.

I say all of this with baited breath but I don't think I'd go back or recommend it to others.  There are much better places with better and well cooked choices than here.  

I'll take my $3 valet charge and apply it to an Uber ride to a different place next time.",2014-07-13 02:58:30

I've had a few things from La Boulangerie: the fruit tarte, the ham & cheese croissant and the chocolate almond croissant. The pastries are really reminiscent of what I had in Europe. Actually, the whole place is really reminiscent of the cafes in Europe. Everything I've had here has been excellent. The pastries aren't dry, and the crust and cream are fresh. I like that the almond chocolate croissant isn't too heavy on the chocolate. The fruit tart is always a hit at gatherings (I would know... I've been to about 4 potlucks/parties where someone has brought one) and loaded with gorgeous fresh fruits. Coffee is decent and they offer almond and soy milk. Prices are very reasonable ($20 for fruit tart, $3-4 for croissants) given the location, quality and ambiance of this place.  

Onto the service: hit or miss. I guess that can be said about a lot of places, so let me clarify. The workers are pretty cold, especially as the place starts to get really busy. But, there was one who was super sweet and even ducked out of the way so that I could get a good picture. Also, the signage is terrible and confusing with the double registers. There is a tiny sign by the register near the gelato that says to order at the other register - this sign is difficult to see.

Pro Tip: Place your order on-line if you're pressed for time! 

Bonus Tip: Come 10 minutes before the noon lunch rush and you're guaranteed to find parking and there's no line! 

They have two lines, one specifically for on-line orders and the other for walk-ins.

The food is just as amazing as I remember it to be and the presentation is just as beautiful. So glad you guys are keeping up with your unique style! Chef Ramon is a master at what he does.

All the tacos are served on a homemade corn tortilla. Not only are they delicious but they are the perfect size, thickness, and holds up very well when eating your taco. Never gets wimpy! 

Let's talk food! 

Here is what I ordered:

Chicken mole taco - The rich dark mole was slightly sweet, nutty and just a tad spicy. I added the peanuts from the salsa bar to give it that extra crunchy nutty flavor. Try it! 

Ensenada taco - Crispy beer battered cod served with cabbage, radish slices, and a mayo lime crema; which my son didn't want so it's not pictured. But he loved the fish tacos! I've had them before too and they are crunchy and yummy. 

Al Pastor taco - The meat was perfectly marinated and the pineapple pairs well giving it a nice sweet and salty taste. They don't skimp on the meat here! 

Quesadilla de Mercado - Not your average quesadilla and by far the best quesadilla I've ever had! Served on a blue corn tortilla with a nice thick slice of seared panela cheese and beautiful fresh market veggies. A true picture perfect masterpiece. The presentation was flawless! I shared half with my son and he was wowed by it too. 

Yes the food is on the pricey side but the quality, care, and effort put into making the food is well worth it to me and there is no other place in town that compares to Corazon! They truly are one of a kind and the food is made from the heart.

After all, a well deserved 2-star experience left a bad taste in my mouth, quite literally, and even hearing from local ownership didn't really seem to sway me to return to this particular location despite my occasional patronage of other spots - especially Castleton and the Northwestside spot. 

However, the recent Thanksgiving holiday found me without a place to go and in my usual holiday funk. So, I joined a friend and we decided we weren't in the mood for Chinese and even Denny's didn't really hit the spot. He'd already checked and knew that Metro Diner was open until 2pm. 

So, Metro Diner it was. 

Now then, I must confess that when ownership or even management reaches out to me I usually am pretty good about giving a spot another try. However, this location has always felt a bit awkward to me. There's an attached parking garage, though the idea of paying for parking is unappealing. There's a side campus parking lot, though one never quite knows if an over-zealous officer will decide to ticket someone - or at least that's what always goes through my mind when I pull into one of those accessible spots. The truth is I've never quite understood the parking arrangement. 

As I noted in my previous review, this location does actually do access fairly well. There's the nearby accessible parking, and I never have received a ticket, along with the garage that also offers accessible parking. Since my first visit, Metro Diner has also arranged for you to be able to park for free for up to an hour. Metro Diner has a nice concrete ramp leading into the restaurant - definitely ADA compliant. The front door usually has staff nearby if you're struggling with the door and the general rule at Metro is that if they see you coming they're going to be at that door (and they usually see you). 

While dining out on a holiday can be a little hit-and-miss considering many employees would prefer to be at home, I didn't sense any disgruntled employees here. Our server, whose name I've since forgotten, shared very openly that he lived nearby and that his family gathering wasn't until 3pm anyway. So, he figured he could earn some money AND enjoy the holiday. It was a terrific attitude and it set the tone for a casual, warm holiday at Metro Diner. 

Unlike my previous visit, service was top notch from beginning to end. It was attentive, yet never intrusive and friendly in a sincere way. We were there from noon until a few minutes before they closed at 2pm and business was steady throughout. 

As I preferred a more traditional meal on this fine and festive holiday, I opted for their pot roast special. It was a healthy serving of pot roast, red-skinned mashed potatoes, and I had my usual unsweetened iced tea. At $11.99, it was a solid value and quite tasty. 

I will say I always find Metro's prices to be a touch high, though it may have felt a little more like sticker shock since I was also paying for my friend's dinner as a late birthday present. However, I will also note that for that price you tend to get bigger servings and higher quality food. 

Overall, there's definitely some redemption here and I can't help but think that my original experience was either a fluke or simply some bugs that hadn't been worked out of the system yet. I was definitely happy with this visit - grateful for a quality meal on a holiday, an enthusiastic employee to serve it, a warm and welcoming atmosphere, and to be able to up this rating and say that this location now pleases me as much as the other Metro spots. As this location is actually closest to my home, I look forward to returning.

Addendum: Approximately two weeks after this visit, a person attempted to use the same credit card I used here to make a substantial purchase. Fortunately, it was caught and denied by my credit card company. Quite simply, there were no other possibilities. Can I say 100%? Nope, but that's a little too scary and despite a better experience here on a return visit I simply can't take that risk. I won't be back.",2018-12-09 13:34:04

Before I was feeling my 3 star rating, now, based on a recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday 2 stars almost seems generous for multiple reasons - 

1.) service - I understand that they have a certain way of seating people on the rooftop but when a birthday party crew enters eager with balloons and flowers to surprise a friend before they arrive and not one table is seated and said guests waited half an hour to be the first in the door - why must you rain so heavily on the parade by making them waiting until the birthday boy arrives to be seated? The way the entire situation was handled was extremely unfriendly and inflexible. To top it off, we were told birthday cakes are not allowed to be brought in - a-okay, I understand - ""can I tuck it away somewhere so it doesn't melt before dinner is over?"" Response: ""hmm...I dunno...."" (aka ""I really don't want to go out of my way on ANYTHING here"")

The food is pretty good. I got the chopped chicken salad which had all of my favorite ingredients, but I didn't love the bbq ranch sauce that was on it. The pretzels and fondue are VERY excellent.

The ambiance of this place is strange. You would think it would be a good place to watch football on a Saturday evening (because of the amount of TVs, drinks and food) but it's not. It's packed with patrons who are there to party. We sat at the bar and the bar stools are the most uncomfortable seats. You can't move them so it was kind of a claustrophobic feeling. And it is LOUD. There was live music and the band was really good but no one was listening to them. Instead, everyone was just yelling trying to have conversations.",2019-09-24 14:40:43

They serve water out of what looks like wine bottles, which was a neat idea.  However, I kinda expected the water to be a little more ice cold than it was.

I like the color scheme - the white and farm house blue was a nice contrast with the ampersands on the coffee cups and employee shirts.

3 of my friends ordered the steak and eggs and liked it, and 1 friend ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and really liked it although he admits he was eyeballing the steak and eggs the whole time.  He said he was glad he really liked his chicken sandwich, or he would have been regretting not getting steak and eggs as well.

Under the ""Sweet"" section of the menu, you find the pancakes and French toast.  I tried the blueberry pancakes ($7.50) and bacon ($3) with a Diet Coke ($2) (see POSTED PHOTO).  You get 3 fairly thick pancakes with blueberry butter.  This was way too much blueberry - too many blueberries in the pancakes with blueberry butter was just too much.  It was way too sweet to me.  The bacon, however, was very nice cuts of bacon, but I think the bacon should come with the pancakes and not be offered only a la carte for $3 for 3 slices.

So on my experience alone, I would have given 2 stars, but since my friends really enjoyed their meals, I have upped it to 3 stars for now.  They have a Black Canyon Angus burger (what is Black Canyon Angus?) with cheddar on a brioche bun that looks tasty, so I hope to get to try that on the next visit, and maybe I can update my review to a stronger 3-star review or even a 4-star.",2011-07-08 22:49:42

We came here after reading the Weekly Yelp and its positive reviews from my fellow Yelpers.  Most people who have lived in Reno and know the town will agree that East Fourth street has not had the most...ahem...good reputation for many years now.  It is refreshing to see such a beautiful building and a large crowd gathered on a Thursday night at this establishment.  Kudos to the owners for bringing such a great place with a welcoming vibe to east Fourth Street.   

The parking lot is narrow and long so you will have to make your way along the back to find a spot.  This isn't a complaint but merely an observation.  Once inside we were blown away by how packed it was.  Lots of guys in suits and lots of ladies sipping cocktails and enjoying themselves.  Honestly it felt like we were at Bricks or Roxys.  The place is beautiful as many of the other reviews have pointed out.  Warm brick accents and wood flooring throughout.  

We were asked if we had a reservation and we did not but were seated right away.  The hostess was friendly and did not give off that ""ohhh you don't have a reservation..."" vibe which was nice.  The room we were seated in was set up for a large party which always makes me shudder because I know that my nice, quiet evening will soon be cut short by a large group of loud, obnoxious folks.  Not the case here.  The service was attentive and quick and I think what kept the large group from getting out of hand was the fact that they had multiple servers tending to them and quite often.  Well done Depot.  

We ordered the Poutine and the cheese plate.  I had wine and my partner had beer.  The poutine was decent.  I wouldn't write home about it but I am a poutine SNOB and have had the bar set pretty darn high.  The cheese curds were very good but the gravy just was meh... The cheese plate was nice.  Don't ask me what kind of cheese was on it because the server didn't tell us.  She just put the plate down and walked away.  When I order a cheese plate I want to know what I am eating.  The cheeses that were presented were tasty but I have NO idea what they were.  When you go to Campo and order the cheese plate they tell you exactly what cheese you are presented with and what the accompaniments are.  

Anyhow, I do plan on returning based on others' experiences here.  We plan on having dinner and I hope to bump the Depot up a star or two.",2015-02-12 03:43:47

But still, I've come to loathe this place for some of its employees and the prices.

Bad apples: one of the checkers (a white-haired woman in her 50s/60s) is consistently crabby and borderline insulting. Today she had an issue redeeming my Raley's custom coupons (the kind Raley's mails you when you have a 'club card'). She asked if the coupons were associated with a different card (they were not). After her audible frustration to her bagger (""I am NOT doing these anymore!"") she manually deducted the coupons. I thanked her but she had to again assert that the problem was my fault (""I ONLY have this problem when the coupon is for a different account""). I would have gone to management to complain if my kid weren't with me.

Prices: ridiculously high on most things relative to Winco (for example) and even Whole Foods (for the natural stuff; as if it couldn't get higher - it can, try Raley's!). The bulk section was the source of my ire today; plain-old raw walnuts in a package were around 50 cents a pound (in the baking section), but in bulk they were 66 cents a pound. Shouldn't bulk be cheaper for the same product? It's little stuff like this all over the store that make me avoid making trips here. It's really only my ""emergency store"" due to its proximity to my house.

Anyway, the pizza is just ok. I usually order by the slice so I can't really say if they put more love into their full pizzas but I'd imagine they are the same. I know all pizza topped with cheese and meat is greasy but the pizza here seems exceptionally greasier. The employees are generally nice although I've had at least twice where either the guy taking my order or the guy taking my money have been a little rude.

We were greeted and seated promptly. Ami was our amazing server. We started the night with couple of appetizers, crab cake beignets and cornbread.

OMG cornbread! So freaking good and moist, buttery! Comes to the table in a cast iron pan, glistening from the butter and topped with a streusel. One of the best things we ate there! 

Next we ordered Cobb salad, it was good. Nothing out of the ordinary. As for entree, we opted for Braised Pork Shank, highly praised by our server.

The original location of Taco Bus is a small cluster of buildings, picnic tables, and two school buses parked near the intersection of Nebraska and Hillsborough Avenues. You actually order your food at the side window of one of these school buses (the yellow one), and your meal is prepared in the kitchen which is contained within the other (white) bus which is parked at right angles.

Taco Bus nailed the whole food truck concept long before the trend became cool in Tampa. Those of us who've lived in Tampa for a number of years have fond memories of staggering up to the bus in the middle of the night, and ordering some very good Mexican street food. Over the years they have expanded from one bus to two, and added some additional seating, but this is still the same relaxed place to roll in, order some tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, quesadillas, and ensaladas with your choice of proteins and toppings. The menu is posted on a banner, alongside the yellow bus, so start over there, and then place your order with the ladies.

If you're eating in, then grab your drink cup and walk over by the other bus (the white one) where you'll find a Coke Freestyle machine. Sit outside at one of the covered picnic tables, or under the covered patio, or inside the little building which also houses the rest rooms. When your food is ready, they'll bring it out to your table. If you like your food spicy, be sure to ask your server for the homemade red and green salsas to punch up the flavor.

I generally get the two taco platter, and my favorite protein is the conchintina pibil which is a traditional Mexican slow-roasted pork dish, which involves marinating the meat in strongly acidic citrus juice, seasoning it with annatto seed which imparts a vivid burnt orange color. I also like the carne asada, chorizo, and shrimp. Taco Bus also offers a variety of chicken, pork, fish, and vegetarian fillings.

For my rolls I ordered a Volcano Roll which was baked crab, whitefish, yamagobo, motoyaki sauce, sriracha and eel sauce.

Now Charley's isn't my top choice for Tampa steakhouses, but it's hard to argue with a free dinner.

Charley's has been family-owned and operated since the mid 1970's, and was founded by Charley Woodsby, co-founder of the Red Lobster chain. Charley and his son Ron now own the Talk of the Town restaurant group, and the steakhouse is the crown jewel of their chain.

Charley's serves only USDA prime and choice Angus steers, ages them for four to six weeks for tenderness and flavor, and then hand cuts the steaks daily to ensure consistent quality. The steaks are then flame-broiled over oak and orange woods in a custom-built pit. They claim that their secret is the pit which cooks all of the steaks, chicken, chops and fresh fish over a 1,200-degree fire. 

As you enter the lobby you'll see a refrigerated case spotlighting all of the different cuts of meat and seafood that are available for dinner. Our group gathered at the bar while we waited for the stragglers, and then we were off to our private dining area in one of the smaller rooms.

The service was fantastic, and the waiter that managed our group of 8 was quick to gather up our drink orders and then return to talk about the menu. He led us through a dizzying array of steaks, chops, wild game, seafood, and Chef's specials along with all of the different choices of sauces and sides. We shared some calamari with shrimp and scallop scampi for appetizers, before diving in to our main courses.

I ordered the T-bone for my dinner, and had plenty to take home for a second meal. The steak was cooked perfectly, and it had plenty of rich flavor. As a group we shared some creamed spinach, grilled asparagus, and smashed potatoes for sides, and there was plenty of that to take home as well.

The official Bier Polizei and Beer Geeks are there to help you select from the 400 cans and bottles of beer in the chilled bier kellers, as well as the 50 or so draft beers, lagers, ales, stouts, etc.

The menu is a fabulous mixture of hearty pub grub sandwiches and very traditional German delicacies. I ordered the veal jagerschniztel which was a pounded and breaded veal cutlet, fried, and then smothered in a delicious brown mushroom and onion gravy. That came with two sides, and I selected sauerkraut and warm German potato salad.  What a delicious lunch!

My waitress recommended a pint of Einbeecker Schwarzbier which was a dark lager, and it perfectly balanced the spicy gravy.

After eating I wandered around inside to see the smaller party rooms / beer halls which would be perfect for hosting a Yelp event (hint, hint). The butcher's case in the back of the store offers homemade sausages, sandwiches, sides, desserts, cheeses, and a large variety of German favorites including spicy mustards and curry ketchup, wines, beers, chocolates, and more.

If you have an interest in home brewing, then Mr. Dunderbak's sells DIY brewing kits along with all of the proper glassware and beer steins.

Raise your glass and toast to Mr. Dunderbak's by saying, ""eine zwei drei, hinunter die Luke!!!""

Square One is a really tackily decorated restaurant in South Tampa, and they have burgers and other bad-for-you foods. 

My turkey burger was actually better than I expected. Really big, juicy, tasty. I also recommend the sweet potato fries.

 One, has a wife and young child to go home to. He has responsibilities that render the screenwriter dreams void. The other will follow his dream, take a few small rolls in movies and TV, work behind the scenes of a few productions and finally work making documentaries.

Nothing ever became of the script..., although the family man wouldnt be surprised to see it ( or the many others) pop up in some form someday. It was this memory that pleasantly crossed my mind as I sat in a Dennys recently. The family man being a few shades greyer and a few pounds heavier than he was back then.

I rarely go to Dennys. Its not a conscious decision, I just feel there are always better options. I had worked  8hrs straight through without a lunch, and I was starved and didnt feel like fast food. Not that Dennys is better than fast food, its just that I wanted to sit down and be waited on.

It wasnt crowded so I was sat immediately and was able to order and get my food quickly, which was what Id hoped. The food was decent. I got a bowl of soup, rolls and meatloaf dinner for under $10.  I felt it was a great deal. The chicken soup was just as good as ive had at Panera. The rolls were odd. Between the consistency and the sweet butter, they were closer to cinnamon buns (without the cinnamon). If you cant tell if i liked this or not, I couldnt either. I know my kids would have liked them. The meatloaf wasnt bad. It had to be the hardest, densest meatloaf ive ever had but it was tasty.

Wow! what a slippery scale of service and food. Having read the reviews of fellow Yelpers, I was looking forward to eating here, especially since I was ""scouting"" places for potential international dinners I host each month.

Perhaps this was an ""off day"" or slow-for-some-reason, because we neither had good service, nor great food. 

The eclectic combo of furniture in the gaily decorated interior reminded me of some of the charming restaurants I visited during the two years I lived in South America. (I know El Salvador is Central America...just sayin'.) But what followed in service and food was less than charming.

We each ordered two pupusas. My first was filled with a very traditional queso con loroco (cheese and savory flower of an edible herb, Fernaldia Pandurata). Good but not great. The second was filled with frijoles (beans) - standard and very run-of-the-mill, lacking seasoning. We topped both with the rustically presented in a mason jar, ""curtido,"" a lightly fermented or pickled slaw made with cabbage, carrots, onions which helped. Off to a fair start.

Then came the first hiccup - no fried plantains! Everything else on the menu was available. This seemed an odd occurrence for a Latin restaurant.

Things fell apart a bit even more when I was served very dry, tough beef shanks on a base of lightly fried yuca (not quite raw, but not adequately done either), slaw and assorted raw veggies as garnish. And, oddly, when the server presented it, she simply stuck a fork in the top (see photo I posted). Sorry, I just didn't get this less than stellar dish and its ?casual? presentation.

The decor is nice and pleasing to the eye, the lighting is somewhat dark, good for ambiance.  The crowd is upscale chic, with a nice dearth of ""frat"" people (even with the close proximity of Drinkers!).  The music is quite low, so you can easily hear conversation.

We were in the roofdeck, and if you've been once, you've been a thousand times.  The type of crowd that comes in is not eclectic.  You will find good looking people dressed well.  The crowd is not diverse - that's usually a bad thing for me, but the crowd here is much more blase - they were much more into their own conversations than interested in the differences of the types of people.  That's refreshing.  I only notice the diversity if I feel out of place - this place doesn't make you feel that way (unless you're in sweats or dressed inappropriately).

The food, however, was just average. The bruschetta that was handed out as an appetizer was delicious--I would have been happier if I could've stuck with that. The caesar salad was gross. The dressing was watery and tasteless and it had ONE crouton buried underneath it. There was also the roughly grated Kraft-type Parmesan sprinkled on top. Very disappointing! I had chicken parm, which was soggy (I'll let this slide a bit because for so many dishes, I'm sure things had to sit out for a bit), but tasted good.

Overall it was a very HIGH/LOW experience and I can't see giving Grimaldi's  a 3rd star because Yelp says that 3 stars is A-OK and this place as a whole is not A-OK.Time to explain...

          I was so eager to try this place and we arrive at 2:30pm or so and upon arrival we are greeted warmly by who seemed to be the host (actually was the Manager, Mari),  were seated and soon after greeted by our server, Bryce.  There are only 3 other tables in the restaurant going at this time.  Bryce is the best part of our experience and gets 5 Stars for her service.  I told her that it was our first time there and that I had a free 18""pizza coupon.  Bryce energetically replied with, ""That's Awesome!"" which is the reply you are supposed to get instead of the eye roll and the sigh that a lot of young servers give instead.  Bryce is the same exact person I want to serve me at every restaurant I go to.  She is young, very pretty, very attentive, and knows the menu.  Bryce said she had been there a little over 3 years.  Grimaldi's has an enjoyable dining area, not that big but they also have patio dining.

     Looking at the menu I see the prices are a little high for pizza but manageable and they do have a wine list which most pizza places don't offer.  A large 18"" is $16 and medium 16"" for $14 with 2 and 4 dollar toppings.  So, we order a large pizza with half plain and half bacon.  First time at a pizza place and I always get a plain pie to see what they have to offer.  We order a 1 liter of SanPellegrino as our beverage for $6.

     So far everything is looking great and if I stopped right here we are looking at 4.5 star rating.  However, the problems start here.  The bottle of Pellegrino is brought to the table with nicely frosted glasses but unsealed.  I don't mean to sound picky but if you go to any restaurant and order a sealed product, that product should come to the table sealed and opened in front of you and Pellegrino is an easy screw cap so there are no bottle opener issues. The sparkling water (by no surprise) was missing the sparkle and we were not offered lime or lemon.  If you ever had Pellegrino then you know that this stuff really packs a punch on the effervescence and you gotta be tough to chug a bottle.

     The pizza comes very soon after and too soon really because I don't think the best pizza chef in the world could make a pizza in less than 10 minutes and have it be served barely above COLD!  Or barely warm. So was it a pre-made pizza that was reheated or just sat there when not busy?  Not sure but it came out way so fast to not be piping hot when served and having to wait a few minutes to eat it.  Also, why not serve Pellegrino opened table side.  Either it wasn't Pellegrino or refilled somehow which doesn't make sense because I think their largest bottle is a 1 liter.  It's hard to say because I don't remember having flat Pellegrino before.

     More on the pizza.  The crust is extremely thin, the thinnest I have ever had and it's not filling at all.  I was told that this is ""Brooklyn Style"" pizza and uh......dunno 'bout that.  I am from New Jersey and I have been to New York many times and never had a pizza like this before and my favorite food is......You guessed it, PIZZA.  I won't say the Brooklyn reference is wrong because like I said, first timer but those guys tossing pies in the New York and New Jersey locations of Grimaldi's would be offended by what I was served.

     The other hero of the day is Mari who was also great comes out with 2 500ml bottles of Pel and says sorry and takes it off the bill but the quality was the same.  Very nice of her to do but I mentioned it was flat and not opened table side and I get 2 more bottles not opened at the table?

     The sauce was sweet but OK. I like the slices of cheese instead of the shredded, nice touch.  I know it's Tucson, AZ but why was the dough dry but doughy with no ""snap"" to it at all. Reheated pizza slices still have the snap.  I also reviewed another pizza place and when you bite in to one of those slices you get that snap.  Not here I didn't for almost double the price and almost half of the food.  The plain cheese pizza tasted OK I guess and maybe would've been better if it was hot.  The bacon topped pizza tasted like bacon.  I know you can never have enough bacon because bacon is awesome but not here.  The pizza is so thin that the bacon took over and that's all what was tasted.

I had their Mayfair dressing on the salad.  It is so tasty for the those not from the Lou Mayfair is the St. Louis version of Cesar dressing.  Since I was very hungry on this visit I ordered the hamburger.  It came with Swiss cheese lettuce pickles can't remember if it had an onion or not.  The burger was cooked to order and came seasoned with a good amount of pepper.  I love pepper and the taste it imparts to a good burger.  The burger also had fries the curly type.  Not a curly fries kind of guy but they did taste very good.  On a side note the waitress did offer to exchange my fries for the salad for my side.  I said no I was err hungry.  Just great food.  Also at my table one person had the french dip and another had a pizza.  From looks only the dip seemed to be a better choice than the pizza.  So I guess in my mind this is not a pizza place but almost a full service restaurant.

This was our 2nd visit. We were hoping the first visit was just an anomaly so we gave it another go this past weekend. What a nightmare! I'll never visit this hotel again. First, I checked in online. I figured that should help expedite the check-in process. NOPE! Then I had to wait in a line in the lobby where there was only one kiosk open for online check-ins...on Labor Day weekend. Smart right? This was an hour wait. There were only 8 parties in front of me. At this one kiosk were 3 hotel employees.....3....all with zero urgency. Then, we learned we had to wait in another line to get our Soundwaves passes...another hour lost. What the hotel doesn't realize is this is counter-intuitive to making money. If the guests are in lines all day, they're not spending more money at the hotel. Very stupid hotel managers. Then, upon check-in, we're told our room isn't ready yet. Now, check-in is at 3pm. However, we didn't get our room until 5:15. Again, really poor management. There were a number of other issues to note but my last rant has to do with dining. There are a number of restaurants inside the hotel. We made our way to the closest one first to have dinner. It had a 45 minute wait. We have 2 little kids. No way 45 minutes is going to cut it. So we walked to the next one. Same thing. And the next one...oh yeah...it was closed. They have monitors located around the hotel lobbies intending to show the wait times for the restaurants. There's only one problem. They only indicated if the restaurant was open or closed. When the property is so large that walking to all of the restaurants is a cumulative total of a mile and a half, the last thing you want to learn is that there are no sets available at any of the restaurants for a least 45-60 minutes. This hotel has no concept of crowd management. I overheard 2 other parties very upset of the long wait times, the constant lines everywhere and the poor signage leading to extensive walking.

I'll start with the good--the bartender in the back was friendly (according to hubby) and gave us a shirley temple for my son for free and big, strong drinks (bloody mary for me, vodka soda for hubby).

However, they have no clue how to cater to a family with kids.  We went at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, not exactly prime time.  The place was pretty much empty.  They sat us at a booth, which was fine, but difficult to maneuver my 9 month old in a booster seat with no straps.  They offered to move us, and I thought it would be fine.

My toddler is admittedly rambunctious; however, we asked if they had paper and crayons.  They did not.  No big deal, but when I gave my son the copy-paper sushi menu (we weren't having sushi) to draw on, our server insisted he give it back to her (""Can I have that back?"" to a 3 year old--really?).  

The food was fine--it generally is.  We had the dinner combination platters--one General Tsao's and one sweet and sour chicken, both with brown rice.  The General Tsao's was spicy in a good way and the chicken in both dishes is good quality and large pieces.  There is not a ton of rice, but that's not just Hoshun; it's tough to get  a lot of rice anywhere.  The hot and sour soup was good with lots of mushrooms and tofu.  I had a crab and crawfish rangoon that was good and an egg roll that was so-so.

So, as we are paying and gathering up to go my son was trying to drink out of my hubby's vodka dredges and being in the huge booth, I couldn't reach him.  The server was back and overheard me asking him to not drink that.  She asked him to help her clean the table and asked for the glass.  Then she turned to me and (unkindly) said, ""was that good enough?  You know, you really have to ask them to help you, it's really the only way to get them to do anything.""  What, Ms. Surly 20-year old?  Now you're giving me parenting advice?

There are tons of slightly higher-end Mexican restaurants around now, and the food quality at Verde was in line with my expectations.  Not great, but better than most of the competition out there.  I had two complaints though:

1)  Attention all restaurants, everywhere:  Appetizers and soups (especially soup) must come out BEFORE the main course, not at the same time.  BEFORE.  BEFORE.

2)  Good LORD it was noisy in there.  Come to this restaurant on a Friday night, and you will yell at your companions all night, or else your companion(s) won't hear you.  Yes, the restaurant must accept full responsibility for this, for two reasons:  A) You chose to put in that concrete floor, with no sound treatment on the walls.  B) You chose to blast loud music all night.  Yes, I understand that in every culinary school in the country, they're apparently teaching prospective restaurant owners that silence is bad, and that it implies your guests aren't enjoying themselves.  That's why every restaurant keeps amping-up the noise and the music, so as not to seem boring to the Millennials.  But, come on people - enough already.  Turn down the music and then buy some of those foam sound treatment panels that they sell to recording studios and High School band rooms.

Just start with any one of those two things, and I'll be back.  I can easily overlook the premature soup thing, since you just opened, and it will undoubtedly take time to get all the glitches ironed out.  No problem at all.  But, the 300-decible sound level I won't excuse.  I don't want to get too graphic here, but my ears felt better after a rock concert than they did Friday night when I got home.",2017-10-02 04:55:14

I was looking for something remotely healthy to order here and when I saw that their salads had more calories than a cheeseburger and french fries, guess what I went with? 
I always thought that one can't go wrong with a burger but I was wrong. Their cheesburger was flavorless, and served on a dried out kaiser roll and the food was luke warm. The french fries could've been better if they were hot, but they were sort of cold.  My friend ordered a salad which looked really good, but I'd have to save up my calories for a day if I wasn't trying to diet (siiiigh).

The rice & beans came on the plate & the sour cream & guacamole came in those tiny bowls.  The tortilla's are so small that you can't put much on them so 1 sour & quac would have been enough for both of us to share.  If nothing extra was added the taco's were just ok.

It's got a very casual, local feel to the joint - you can pretty much sit where you want, whether it's at the assortment of tables inside or on the few that are out on the sidewalk corner. The breakfast menu is relatively standardized, though with a local flair to the items. I went with the scrambled eggs and citrus-poached salmon and was pleasantly surprised - it wasn't the freshest filet of salmon I've ever had, but the citrus flavor really tastes quite good, particularly in the morning paired with eggs. The scrambled eggs were also pretty well-executed - fluffy and slightly runny. I was also a fan of the $3 glass of OJ, which didn't look fresh-squeezed (at least since it came out of a carton), but it wasn't from concentrate, and nothing helps jump-start you like a good dose of Vitamin C.

The baked goods did look good, but I was in no mood to contemplate eating sweets in the shape I was in.

- Peach Oolong Tea
- Raspberry Green Tea
- Vanilla Cold Brew

The teas were really good, and although the vanilla cold brew were also good, it was not strong enough for me.  I had ordered an americano when I was at the table, and it was on point!

We had order the following:

- Crab Daddy Biscuit - soft shell crab, Cajun gravy, sunny egg over biscuit - crab guts were nice and fat, well seasoned, just a little tad bit too salty, but overall very delicious

- Cat Daddy Biscuit - chicken, Cajun gravy, sunny egg over biscuit - also very delicious and filling

- Brisket Hash - slow roasted brisket, egg in hole, gluten friendly mornay - brisket was tender and delicious, but a bit heavy for morning time

- Shrimp and Grits - gulf shrimp, stone grits, nola bbq, grilled bread - good consistency on the grits, sweet, plumped shrimp and delicious sauce

- Bearcat Breakfast - two eggs, crisp potatoes, bacon & bison sausage, add pancakes - the potatoes were super bomb!! As was the bison sausage!!

Definitely a great spot to get some food, cannot wait to come back!",2019-10-12 21:05:59

The naan was probably the best part of the entire meal. The entrees were mostly rice, which was fluffy and delicious, but the actual dishes left much to be desired. The chicken in the vindaloo dish was extremely dry, and the sauce had very little flavor. It basically tasted like plain tomato sauce. The lamb and spinach dish also was quite dry, but at least had more flavor than the vindaloo dish.

I'm a little nostalgic about Angeli (as lots of people are) because 10 years ago, this was where I shared my first meal with my partner. For years people have been telling me how horrible it's gotten so I've stayed away until now - but I get why it's earned such a bad rep. With over 1300 restaurants in the city, this place needs to do better if it's going to last. It's in an incredible location - it should be booming! I'm in a position that recommends restaurants to tourists daily and I can't, in good conscience, recommend this place at all for any purpose. Why would I when there's better pizza and pasta (all with a better atmosphere) within a short walking distance from several other places? It just doesn't make sense for me to recommend it  over LPK, Italian Barrel, Mona Lisa's, Turtle Bay, or even Frank's... Every one of those places (with their similar menu items) beats the food, service, and atmosphere at Angeli's and they're all within earshot. 

The one saving grace? The feta triangles were pretty good. The pizza and pasta were all just something to scarf down in order to move on to the next location of the evening - definitely not worth coming back to.

First I arrived for my lunch and there were plenty of tables available, only a couple were taken and the server (lady) sat me at a table that isn't balanced, so it moves everytime you touch it. I don't like to eat on ship, so I asked to be moved. I don't understand why that would be her first choice for me, and I sat at the table right next to my table that had all four feet touching the ground at the same time. 

Now the food is decent, sometimes 3 stars, sometimes 4 stars, today was 3 stars, but my, ""Eek"" is service and what is a terrible dining experience. The servers are total Nazis when it comes to giving the standards you come to expect w/ Mexican dining, sufficient tortillas, sour cream and guacamole, that are suppose to come w/ your meal. 

You are given you a baby to child size portion and if you want more they want to charge you. It's feels like a bait and switch, this comes w/ your meal, but you only give enough for a taste, not enough to satisfy your meal, unless you pay up.

The food isn't cheap here folks, if it was, I wouldn't mind, it's above average pricing, and they don't do lunch menu/specials. This place likes to serve everything extra big, so they charge you more, but you get a bigger burrito, or a large size of sizzling fajitas, but then they extremely short change you and give you smaller than a tablespoon of guacamole, or sour cream. 

Today my 2 very small ramekins were about 1/4 full of guacamole and 1/3 full of sour cream. ""I asked if that was it, and just like the soup Nazi on Seinfeld, yes that's it, with a demeaning tone"" like I should praise the lord I got any, although it says on the menu, served w/, like you actually get some. It's doesn't make sense, I have never seen a place that was so stingy w/ something some many places are proud to serve you, so you can enjoy your meal. It's like getting 4 large pieces of toast and 1 small pat of butter and 1 small jam packet. 

I don't like eating meals feeling they don't care how I feel eating there, and that's how I feel when I eat at Anna's. They don't care how I feel when I eat, unless I want to get shaken down for a few more bucks to get treated properly and get what should come w/ my meal. This is because they don't things right and DON'T give you the right portions to complement the prices you are paying their their food. My lunch today (Asada Chimichanga only) was $9.99 plus tax, so not cheap. 

Last time I was there, I got Fajitas and I got 2 small tortillas, and wasn't offered or allowed more, although my portion needed at least 4 of them. It was $12-$14  for the Fajitas, so not cheap. When I wanted more or anything, tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, it was an add on, what I received w/ my meal, was a similar serving size of guacamole and sour cream as today too. 

I eat down the street and get plenty of guacamole and sour cream included with my lunch special, and every other place in town is happy to hand you a sufficient amount of guacamole or sour cream, tortillas, etc. especially w/ Fajitas, it's standard to serve a hefty side of guac and sour cream w/ them. I don't get this place, and I don't care anymore, OVER ANNA'S!

There's way better places to eat where I enjoy my meal and my dining experience, and the business wants to me enjoy myself, and actually respects my wallet!

We were almost half way through our hour, so I asked the hostess, where should be sit to get our order in the fastest and she recommended the bar. I have eaten here one time, I had the pork shoulder, it was okay, nothing special. Today I tried the At Water Burger. It's sounds really good on the menu, but didn't hit all the notes I was expecting. 

The avocado or guacamole on there was more of see but not taste, and the blue cheese was very strong, which is to be expected. It was an okay burger, fresh meat, cooked close to order (Medium) closer to medium well, but I notice fresh meat tends to do that. The burger was just okay, nothing exciting about it, tasty wise, topping balance, just okay. The fries were the same okay. The ketchup probably has sriracha and was interesting. 

The server was great, super fast taking our order and super fast on the food delivery, so BIG UPS for that. So without a drink and tipping 20%+ it was over $18, and to me at that price point it should be a WOW, that was the great fricking burger and fries EVER, and it was just okay, and something I wouldn't order especially at the the price point. 

I like the look of the place, and the service, but the food 2x for me now, hasn't delivered on the expectation or meeting My Value Equation!

""Taste + Price + Quantity + Quality + Service (Which Varies) = My Value Equation""

Last point, the faucets in the men's bathroom, need adjusting, the spray is so hard, it bounces off your hands no matter where you place them. It sprays onto your clothes.

We got right in, and the busser came by for our drink order. It was a little complicated, but no biggie. 

My dad decided on the 16oz T-Bone special for $15.99, my mom a patty melt, and myself chicken fajita's. It wasn't busy in the pace at 6:30PM, and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. 

My dad's steak looked overcooked, so I asked him to cut it while the server was present and he was having problems, so the server left, then he finally cut in and it was well done not medium rare like he ordered. It was also very thin for a T-Bone. I mentioned he should send it back and the server already say it was my dad was cutting, and got another ordered, so I thought this was impressive. 

Mine came with corn tortilla not flour, we got that corrected. Mine was good, not a ton of chicken, about 7 to 8 strips, lots of peppers and onions, a small but fair amount of guacamole and sour cream, and very low grade beans (can) and overcooked crusty spanish rice that looked cooked maybe at lunch time and sitting in a warmer. 

My mom's burger looked okay, not great, not inedible, but the Coleslaw she got looked saggy and sad, and not fresh either, looked liked they had thousand island in it. 

My dad got his 2nd steak, it was cooked closer to medium rare, but the problem you have with very thin steaks, they never really cook right (looked raw in the middle), in this case, the steak was very gray on the outside with hardly any grill marks on the steak. I imagine the grill there is not very hot or the cooks don't know how to cook steak, but it just wasn't much better. I think the overcooked steak was probably the way to go here. 

Overall, I would give the chicken fajitas 3 stars, service 3.5 stars, and the rest of the food 2 stars. It's a place I would eat again if necessary, but wouldn't choose it again with other options available.

I am always looking for a great breakfast spot, that is quick and easy, inexpensive and delicious, a real value! So I heard this was the place, big portion, small price, great taste. I was going to go there for lunch on a Tuesday, but at 1PM the parking lot was bare. I questioned the recommendation, as a place with food that good, and aggressively priced, should be busy. That day, however, I got scared and drove on, saying I would wait until I did breakfast, since that is what I was going on, I didn't want to tell my coworker it was disappointing, if lunch was not as good as breakfast. Thank god, I did, as you read on...So I woke up early on Saturday, August 15th and decided to give it a go. When I arrived no one was in there, but I moved ahead. The lady working the counter, probably was Mom could of cared less that I was there spending my money, but alas did take my order. I had a bad feeling, that somehow it wasn't clean, although on the surface it looked clean. They just didn't look like people who made sure to wash their hand before preparing my food, and they were up to many other tasks. You know when you walk in and the cook is busy managing his restaurant. I didn't specifically watch the cleanliness, I sat down and read my RNR. I then rec'd a breakfast burrito with Chorizo, which I promptly added on properly iced in a metal container Hot Sauce. I added ample HOT sauce, as I can stand the heat. I proceeded to eat a breakfast burritio that surpingsly had no beans or rice, but was mixed well with the egg and the burritio. I thought it a fair taste and went on my way. About 2 hours later, trouble hit. I had a movement that hurt. HURT BAD. It was the first of many. I know the old adam about food poisoning, but I am believer that our HIGHER faculties of self know things, and my body knew this food was NO GOOD. It quickly exited my body with lots of pain and blood, that I am still feeling as I write this review. Sad to say, I think the only thing missing here was an attention to washing THY hands, and I would not have had a problem. Do I feel like I could complain, not with the lack of the passion the mom or whoever took my order showed. I would surely pass on Super Taqueria, and I wish I could recommend my other place, but there really missed the mark as well  the last two times I ate there, I'll give you a hint though, it's on Virginia St and open 24hrs. My question, why is PASSION and ATTENTION TO DETAIL and CLEANLINESS missing? Are people that are taking our money, gambling with our Life and Health, that LAZY? That sad part is creating Food for others can be such a JOY.

First, it's LOOKS GOOD, they did a great job creating a classic but nice atmosphere, as you know, most times I focus on the food, and price, but I do appreciate when a place is nice enough to take a date too, and this place makes that mark. 

Service, on point, quick and efficient, and who doesn't love some food given to you right away, and when you are a Dragon, you most definitely appreciate, not 1 but 2 different dips for your chips! I would give my first batch of chips 3, today, 3.5. 

I am not sure if the chips grew on me or what, but I appreciate the fact today, they really tasted good. They serve this bean dip (Si Amigos live again!) with the chips, then they give you salsa, but it's more like the sauce, with minimal chunks, but it's good. I enjoy both, and they serve a carafe of extra sauce/salsa. That's a great touch, and I appreciate variety and anticipation of enjoying a sauce/salsa, knowing they make sure you don't need to ask for more because if they did it right, you will be pouring more, as I did today! =)

Last I have tried two meals, and if you know me, I appreciate value, and Casa Grande delivers in 2 ways, first M-F has changing daily specials $6.95, and 2nd, they got an even better happy hour $4.95. The lunch special ends at 3, and Happy Hour starts at 3. I tried both Chili Verde lunch special - 4-5 stars, and today I tried Shredded Beef Flauta's (like a medium size triple Chimichangas cut in half w/ plenty of SOUR CREAM), 5 stars all the ways. 

I left FULL, could barely eat my last split Flauta. My only tip is they need to do 2 things: 1) serve extra napkins automatically, there's nothing worse than looking around for a napkin and every table is clean as doctor's office. 2) Anything that needs to be cut or can be cut to eat, needs a steak knife standard.

I was starving this morning, and hit up Atlantis, my favorite for breakfast buffets, but it's still under remodel. I was quite hungry and now I was buffet committed, and decided on the next most convenient option, The Island Buffet at the Peppermill, knowing too, you get local love (20% off at all restaurants)! 

I arrived and got seated quickly, the buffet was sparse on customers. I already knew I wanted a fresh cooked omelet to start. Due to my large appetite, I quickly filled up a plate while waiting for it to be prepared of bacon, corned beef hash, ham, home style potatoes, maple sausage, and another potato version. 

I got my omelet with the kitchen sink included, added some sour cream, and sat down. The omelet was okay, nothing special. I dug into my other dishes, the only ones that were decent were the bacon and ham. The rest fell flat, too salty, flavors were off, and just not satisfying.  

You know when you look at food in a buffet and it doesn't look appetizing, you think you know it's not going to deliver on taste, but you try it anyways, hoping that your wrong, that's how I felt there, and that's what I tasted on the dishes, so at this point I was over the cooked food. 

I perused around and decided on fresh cantaloupe and pineapple. These were both abundant and tasty. After that I hit up the salad bar, they had all the usuals, plus some other salads like you get in a supermarket deli, so I tried most of them. Nothing was fantastic, but more satisfying  than the cooked food. 

Overall, I wouldn't eat this breakfast again, unless I wanted fruit and salad for breakfast, bacon, and maybe an okay omelet. I have been here on Saturdays with the carving stations, and that provides a better taste and value.",2016-02-25 18:23:19

They have held my attention for over 20 years (dagnabit!) with fantastic dishes like salmon fish and chips, which they no longer have. Great burgers!, Great beers! Great atmosphere and great service!

Alas, this was not the case during our last burger night.

Let's go back in time to 8-29-2017. Our burger night group decided on Great Basin Brewing (GBB). I was champing at the bit with mouth watering desire to sink my teeth into a really good burger!
Our friends (Angie and Bill) arrived first as we frantically fought traffic and road destruction trying to get to downtown Sparks. 
After being seated the waitress took my beer order (Cantaloupe Wit) and within a few minutes, my cantaloupey tasting beer was at the table an on my lips. Not my favorite beer but I had to try it!
I ordered the Black & Bleu burger as did my wifee. My dad ordered the patty melt with no special sauce. And, we all got garlic fries!
I didn't time it, but it felt like the burgers took just a bit longer to arrive than normal. Not a bad and that wasn't my complaint. 
When the burgers arrived, I noticed that my burger was smashed and like many burgers that are smashed, they appear like they are falling apart. After taking a bite of the cardboard burger, I realized it was dried out and was woefully disappointed. The garlic fries were crispy and soft inside. Just the way a great fry should be. But, compared to what they were, there was hardly any garlic on them! Very disappointing. 
I asked my dad how his patty melt was. His answer was not enthusiastic at all. He, instead of telling me showed me that the special sauce was put on his patty melt and oozing out the sides of the rye bread, despite the fact that he specifically asked to have it left off. Yes, I remember him stating that.

When the waitress did her satisfaction rounds and asked how things were. I didn't mention my burger but we did mention my dad's patty melt. 
Her answer shocked me after my dad told her there was special sauce on the patty melt. The waitress said that it's too late for her to open it up and scrape it off. WTF is that!?!? That was not what I wanted to hear and I almost got up but didn't. 
She followed up with asking if she could get him something else, to which my dad said no.
There was no more conversation about replacement meal, partial discount of the meal or even a full comp. 

What started out as a potentially five star rating, dropped to 4 with a dried out smashed burger and to a three star with the waitress's response.
Not only that, I'm sure it will be years before we step inside again.

Bottom Line
----------------

I was very disappointed. Though I will enjoy there beers, I doubt that I will patronize either of there locations for quite some time and it's a shame since I really enjoyed this place. 
Perhaps it was a bad waitress
Perhaps it was a bad cook
Perhaps it was a bad manager

Perhaps I'll go somewhere else for burger night",2017-08-30 19:57:22

Our friends invited us here and I am not a seafood, sushi, ramen fan, haha! I know!!!  So immediately my taste preference for American food really drew me to the Crispy Brussels and even the Potato Fries! I also really wanted to give it a shot too. I've never really had GOOD ramen or noodles etc.  So I compromised, with the Crispy Brussels and the Garlic Noodles.  The CB's were amazing. Each bite was a lottery, you didn't know if were going to get a crispy bite, a saturated bite, it was like each bite was different but good.  Sometimes they seemed a little too rich.  Garlic noodles everyone raved about.  As my first Garlic Noodles experience, it was just so-so.  I mean, maybe these were incredible comparatively speaking but since this isn't my jam, I don't know that I'm a good judge.  I **think** your entire party has to be there in order to sit down for a reservation or get on the wait list, which would be important to know.  We also tried the Warrior cold Sake, and it was decent.  The sparkling flavored drinks looked really good, I wish I would have tried one of those.  Probably the grapefruit ginger one, although the hibiscus cucumber sounded pretty good too!

PROS:
- Vibe with the moody lights, it's good
- They have a bar! It's pretty cute
- Patio lights, way cool
- The booth was so comfy
- I don't even remember if there was music on, but if so it wasn't overbearing so we didn't have to scream over it to have a conversation
- Our server was AWESOME, he was super helpful and really patient with me trying to find something I would like.

TIPS:
- There's a sign on the clear doors that say EXIT ONLY.  That doesn't mean the entrance is around the other side of the building first-timers! The entrance is the big wood door next to the clear one with the sign.
- Make a reservation, they are busy
- Parking can be sparse, so if someone is pulling out just take their spot (the first one you see)
- The tab can add up quickly so if that matters just be sure to pay attention (and if it doesn't matter, try ALL THE THINGS)!!",2018-10-04 03:51:54

We sat for the next fifteen-minutes with no waitress coming over. I headed over the the hostess stand and asked if they could send someone over. There were only a few other tables sat in the whole place and it was not busy. Five minutes later a manger headed over apologizing that our waiter was new and was nowhere to be found. They sent another waitress over which unfortunately did not go smooth at all. We did not enjoy the experience and service which is sad because we really do enjoy the food at Outback.

The service had a lot to be desired.  I ordered and waited, and then added a soda and a spam musubi to which the waitress seemed thoroughly annoyed about, what happened to upselling?  First she said she couldn't take cash for the extra's because they were counting the drawer???  I enjoyed the food, and I was debating between 2 kinds of chicken - the waitress did tell me she liked the Katsu better, which I did appreciate.  The macaroni salad was the best thing on my plate.  I told her the spam musubi was for later, but she still had it heated up, and didn't tell me.  I just stood there waiting instead of her telling me it would be a moment, to which I could have said don't bother heating it up, I don't plan to eat it now.

The reason my return is unlikely is because of their payment policy. To begin with I have a problem with cash only brick and mortar establishments. It just indicates that there's something shady going on. I pay my taxes and I expect local business to pay theirs too. When it's cash only I suspect (with no foundation in fact) that not all of the sales are being reported. But at untouchables it goes one step further. Here, there is a credit card looking machine right next to the cash register. Only it's not a credit machine, it's an""ATM"". So basically you eat dinner here, you done have enough cash to pay for it and they force you to use the credit machine only instead of a standard transaction it's an ATM complete with foreign transaction fee from your own bank as well as the convenience fee that the""ATM""charges. So the $10 dinner ends up costing$15 and the restaurant is actually the beneficiary of$3 of those extras.

Waiter asked if we would like to move to a booth, so we did! 
We were BOTH SO EXCITED for this place to open! Have been waitingggg to try it! 
Asked our server what was good, she said sriracha shrimp! Shrimp on pizza? 
WHY don't they have BBQ CHICKEN Pizza!!??

We were told we had to order the Large if we wanted to do half and half. Kind of annoying? And the only difference between a medium and a large is 2 slices! 

Asked about the root beer on draft, she just said wanna sample!? Agreed tried it and ordered it. Still not sure what kind, where's it's from, or who makes it? It was a very smooth, vanilla had a nice foam head! It was very good! I do recommend trying it!

Ordered a glass of root beer, a small Caesar salad, and a large half and half sriracha shrimp, and Thai 

Salad was good!  Pizza looked good, but was almost flavorless. It didn't have any flavor. Also didn't have any pizza sauce. It was so bland. We were so disappointed. 

We watched the table next to us order beer. Their server never came back by their table, someone else came dropped off the beer after the customer asked for it. Server came back but never apologize for not bringing her the beer she ordered. They actually ended up just walking out. 

There was what appeared to be 3 managers walking around. None of them ever walked up to any of the tables asking if food/service/drinks were good or bad? Or simply just stop but the tables and chat with the customers?

I don't know why they are all the same here. I can only assume that they are all hiring their equally less intelligent friends or something.

I'm not sure if they make it themselves, but it compliments any salad they have on the menu. Their wings are also really great. They have a variety of flavors, including the work place favorite; sweet chilli. I would definitely say ordering from them is totally worth it. The girl who usually takes my order during the week (I think her name is Samantha) is such a sweet heart. She's always so polite and patient.

Since most of NOLA doesn't really do breakfast, it must be nice to have a place close that you can get some morning grub. The prices seem to be decent for breakfast and like most ""Coffee places""  the coffee prices are too expensive and this coffee is a bit bitter. Nothing 6 creamers can't help.

My over medium eggs were really close to correct. Better than most places.
The hash browns are NOT HASH BROWNS. I think New Orleans cooks need to look up hash browns so they don't keep mixing up home fries for them. They were good home fries, but they were not hash browns.

Free chips and salsa as most good places do, but be prepared for a different kind of salsa. It's warm and not overly-filled with cilantro (which makes me happy).

This is the place that The Girly gets her favorite Chimichanga from. They are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and unlike most places, not too salty.

I've had the chimichanga and the quesadilla myself and both were good. They are a bit skimpy on the guac but still pretty good good. 

The prices are about a buck or two per dish more than I like but I'm a cheap bastage so take that for what it's worth.

I kind of like it - there aren't many places that offer first come first served, so Carina is perfect for a night when you didn't plan ahead but still want a nice dinner.

There is a short list of cocktails and also red, white, rosé and sparkling wine, which you can get by the glass or bottle. The menu is broken into starters, salads, pastas, mains and sides. We wanted to try a little of everything so we ordered the meatballs, pumpkin salad, tagliatelle with bolognese, shells with crab, branzino and broccoli. 

I thought all of the food was nicely prepared and presented and tasted great. I love a good plate of pasta and neither of our pasta dishes let me down. The shells may have won out by a small margin - the tomato sauce was just spicy enough and I loved the toasted breadcrumbs for some texture.

I asked for extra room in my cup after noticing that the coffee was filled to the brim. My boyfriend, unfortunately, did not. When he picked up his cup, it started to buckle causing hot coffee to spill all over his hands. So unless Talula's decides to upgrade their cups, do yourself a favor and ask for room so you don't suffer the same fate. 

Aside from that unfortunate mishap, I have mostly positive things to say about this place. The dining area is very cute, though shared tables are a concept that not everyone seems to grasp. Sharing is caring, folks!  

There's currently a check-in offer for a free cookie, which I am looking forward to claiming. The aforementioned turkey and Swiss croissants were quite delicious.

Their mushroom soup was too heavy for my taste, but if you love mushrooms and are looking for a soup that will stick to the ribs, you'll probably want to try it. 

I'd really love to check out one of the dinners sometime. Until I do, I'll be swinging by for more food to go or a quick bite in.",2013-11-26 19:53:22

I parked the car illegally and stood watch while my partner in crime ran inside for breakfast sandwiches. 

My choice was the pancetta hash, with two fried eggs, pancetta, breakfast potatoes, and fontina. We got home and tore open our packages. Mine came in a cardboard to-go box, and when I opened the lid the first thing I noticed was the pool of egg yolk covering the entire bottom of the box, leaving the whole underside of my sandwich completely soaked and really messy. Meanwhile, the roll was really tough and also very large, and it overpowered (what was left of) the ingredients in the sandwich. If you do feel compelled to order the pancetta hash to go after reading this, be sure to order it with scrambled eggs. 

This was my first time ordering breakfast at Plenty; normally I have sandwiches and almost always the tasso ham panini, which is incredible. I'm looking forward to swinging by again soon, and hopefully updating my review once that happens.",2013-12-06 14:39:28

For reasons still unknown to me (and against warnings from friends, family and spiritual advisors), I agreed to watch game one with a born and raised New Yorker, who had relocated to Philly in adulthood.  During discussions of where to watch the game, it was discovered that homeslice had never hung out in the Dirty Jerz, or more accurately, Southern New Jersey.  We agreed it was high time to pop that cherry, and I couldn't think of a more Jerztastic place to do it than Tom Fischer's.  

The bar was packed with Phils fans young and old at game time.  Our waitress got right on our drinks and kept them coming through the night.  I had always heard great things about the bar food and it was the perfect night for enjoying some greasy grub.  Everything we were looking at was priced around five or six bucks, so we ordered three things thinking they would be on the small side.  Looking back, I do wish our server would have said something like ""FYI, our servings are pretty big here!"" or ""Save some food for everyone else, fatties!"" but we got none of that.  What we did get was a huge basket of pizza fries, a heaping pile of nachos with hunks of breaded chicken, loads of cheese and diced green onions, accompanied by salsa and sour cream, and buffalo chicken tenders.

About those buffalo chicken tenders.  I am thrilled to report to all city dwellers that you can cancel your Philly Car Share reservations because there is no longer a need to trek all the way to Pic-a-lilli's in Shamong, NJ.  Just hop on PATCO and jump off in Collingswood.  Walk east on Atlantic until you are smack dab in front of Tom Fischer's.  No joke, I would not know the difference from TF's buffalo chicken tenders and the ones they serve at the Pic.  The sauce was tangy but not too hot and with a touch of sweetness.  I would imagine the wings are comparable but I'll have to check them out sometime in the future.  They also do takeout- happy football Sunday to me!

Our experience was pretty awesome (for me, anyway - the New Yorker was a little butthurt) through the game.  The service was good, food was great, game was awesome and the people-watching was hysterical.  Please refer to my ""local photo"" to see what I mean.  After the game, however, things took a turn for the dicey.  Without getting into details, let's just say that sometimes small towns bring out small minded individuals.  A slob on the opposite end of the bar made a very loud, obnoxious comment that would have been inappropriate in any setting.  It was an unfortunate way to end what had been a really fun night, otherwise.  I know it's not the bar's responsibility to censor clientele, but it does speak for the types of clientele they attract.",2009-10-29 16:32:29

My very first experience with soup dumplings actually took place at Bing Bing on the tail end of a girls night out a couple months ago. I thought they were delicious, along with a few other things I was able to try (that bubble tea cocktail - love!), and I couldn't wait to go back. 

Saturday, my fiancé and I decided to swing by for Bing Bing's first lunch service. Apparently the masses had not yet been informed so we were seated right away. The servers were all so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. They recommend ordering 2-3 plates per person. We ordered: kimchi pork soup dumplings, turnip cake, rice noodle rolls, pan fried bao (mushroom and cheddar), xo chicken wings. We were also treated to the green beans, which are really delicious. 

The soup dumplings were so awesome. I may need my own order next time. Though I certainly wouldn't have room for anything else - the food is very filling and we took enough home for a hefty snack. The bao are pretty large; I loved the taste of the mushroom and cheddar. The turnip cake is super unique and fun to eat. I'd probably pass on the rice noodle rolls in the future only because I enjoyed everything else so much more. Looking forward to my next visit!",2015-06-01 17:33:20

My boyfriend and I stopped by last night to check the place out and grab a beer, and that was my first impression. The music had a hard rock tilt and the art was strange and edgy. We found two available seats at the bar and surveyed the crowd. It looked like everyone there had been at the Phillies game earlier in the day. We perused the menu. Short and not interesting enough to grab a snack (although what did go past looked good). We ordered our beers and watched the end of the Flyers game, which was conveniently showing on the TV in front of us. 

Then, a very drunk man tapped my boyfriend on the shoulder, which he ignored. The guy started giving me a weird look, which I also ignored. He moved past me, further down the bar, and as he started making his way back, he smacked my ass on his way by. 

Internal monologue: ""OH NO HE DIDN'T!!!""

Ponytail swingin' and mouth a-movin', it's safe to say my Jersey was showing. My man stood up and things could have gotten very ugly, but I came to my senses and got the attention of a bartender. Within a few seconds, a bouncer made his way over and the situation was handled swiftly and quietly. The staff was extremely apologetic, and they bought us our next round, which was very sweet. 

I really don't know what the future holds for this place. I do miss my Swift Half and it felt weird being there for another business. I'd consider going back, but I wouldn't go out of my way, either.

There isn't much on tap but the five or six beers are mostly local and cover the bases. I had gumbo on my first visit while my fiancé had a shrimp po boy (which I ordered on my second visit). Both were very good. The gumbo had a slow burning heat - use caution before adding any hot sauce! The po boy was overflowing with fried shrimp and it was totally delicious.

However, I'm regretfully pulling stars after my recent dining experiences at Resurrection. Last time, a cheese plate was awesome but a risotto-style dish was a bit monotonous. Jalapeño-accented falafel bites were cute and tasty, but overpriced at eight bucks for five or so small pieces. 

Today I was excited to check out brunch. A chorizo and manchego omelet with a side of greens caught my eye right away. My request for egg whites was unfortunately denied. After looking over the menu some more, I decided to deal with the extra calories from whole eggs and I went with the omelet. At first glance, it was pretty and nicely sized. But once my fork cut through, the plate was swimming in butter. I had a few bites of egg and picked out the chorizo slices, but turned my focus to the side of greens and the heirloom tomato salad we ordered on the side.

Then we ordered half a chicken diablo and a skirt steak. While waiting we were offered a wonderful crusty tasty bread with butter. I believe the butter was infused with garlic and herbs. Delicious! A few minutes after placing the orders I realized we were not asked if we would have a soup or salad with our entrees. Before I had a chance to ask our waiter, our entrees were served with no soup or salad. After getting the entrees I asked about the soup/salad option. Our waiter didn't skip a beat- just asked politely-which one would you like? I'd have really preferred to have my salad before my entree. How can one not take the full order? Anyways, halfway through our meals I did get my salad and my companion got her soup. The salad was very good, nicely seasoned and fresh. The soup was ok-sausage and lentils. It was kinda heavy. The chicken was bland and dry. The steak was dry and chewy. The best part about both was the mascarpone mashed potato-rich and flavorful, and the consistency was right on point.

My family started going to him when I was just a kid, and we were still in North Philly. Now I have my own insurance and can choose my own dentist, but I still make a trip every six months - and maybe sooner if we've been bad - to see him. He's known me for at least 21 years. Ridiculous, right?

Part of the tradition of Vichet getting a tooth pulled/drilled/cybernetically enhanced is that I always pass by the Adams Avenue shopping plaza, a local Asian small-business dominated lot that is home to Cafe Saigon. And a Pho 75. And a Dunkin' Donuts. And an IHOP. More on those later. 

We'd usually get lunch at the Pho 75, then my mom would pick up some munchkins (really, mom? Right after getting a cavity filled?)  while my dad got us a couple of hoagies at Cafe Saigon.

Anyway, my point here is that, like my dentist, I've been coming to this place for Vietnamese hoagies for longer than I have a clear memory of anything. They're the perfect combination of meaty, crunchy, fresh, toasty and buttery. I want one right now. I kind of want one all the time. This is part of the reason my dentist has so much work to do.

All you need to know is that it's three for a regular, three-fitty for a barbecue beef.

What I like especially about the hoagies that this place slings is that they really load you up on the pickled carrot and daikon, and jalapenos slices. Also, if you do get the barbecue beef, they pile it on, and it's still tender and smokey from being cooked.

If you're ever out this way (I doubt you will be unless you live in the Northeast or have business there), try this place out. Cash only, but hey, it's only 3 bucks.

I definitely run the risk of making this overly lengthy because of how much I have to say so I will try to make this as terse as possible.

Now, this is my second time trying this restaurant as I felt my first time must have been bad day for the chef, both times I ordered the same thing; The Bone in Ribeye, and both times I was equally as disappointed. The steak, I don't know..., just confused me. I honestly did not understand what I was eating,  any donut who enjoys steaks will attest, the main component adding to a great steak's appeal it is the hard sear on the outside and the medium rare center. If you cook your steak right, and leave it to rest enough you should achieve this perfect sear and have a warm center, creating a contrast in the texture; the hard outer sear, and a tender center. 

This ribeye had neither, though it was cooked to a perfect medium rare (visually), there was no sear on the outside  and the inside was oddly singeing hot, which still does not make any sense to me. I Imagine the steak was broiled in some form after it was cooked which will explain why the plate was scalding also, but this made for a really peculiar eating experience I truly truly did not care for. The steak was burning hot but still medium rare, it truly felt like someone chucked the steak into a microwave after it was cooked. The resulting offering was a flabby steak, red in the center but inedible because of how hot it was and the un-rendered fat.

All that aside, the appetizers and sides were, okay, I guess, but this is a steakhouse so who cares how good the appetizers are. My two stars are honestly for the service, despite the strict dress code and  spending minimum, this place is not pretentious or snobby at all, the staff are inviting and very welcoming, too bad the meal was not just as up to par.",2021-06-20 23:22:24

Heard alot of great things from people who visited in other places on the East Coast. It shocked us that on a Sunday that they had happy hour.

If I had to do it over again would just order a white wine and crab cakes. 

It took forever for our chicken, potatos and spinach to come out. Spinach was super good too. Customer service was good. Wasn't a wait on Sunday night and parking is pretty good and valet is also an option.

I popped in again because Ming's--my go-to--was closed for vacation. My breakfast burrito was good enough, but the accompanying hash browns were the consistency of dry mashed potatoes--my only guess is that the has browns had been on the stove so long that they completely broke down into mush. It's a good thing there's hot sauce on the table, because it was needed to make the hash browns edible.

My breakfast partner had pancakes, which were fine . . . although he was disappointed to get pancake syrup in a small plastic container rather than real maple syrup to pour.

Service was lackadaisical at best. It started off well enough: we were dropped off at our table, drink and food orders taken relatively quickly. But then our server disappeared. We had track down an employee to ask for coffee refills. Food took quite some time to arrive at the table. 

I don't mind a leisurely-paced breakfast; however, this place gets so loud that it's hard not to get a headache, and it's impossible to have a conversation with the person sitting next to you without raising your own voice and adding to the general cacophony.

Not bad. But not amazingly good either. Just in between I guess. Also I must caution all who read this review that I only ordered 1 thing from the menu so it's probably not the be all to end all review for Ginger. (Does anyone think of ""ginger kids!"" when they hear the name of this place? LOL! A bistro run by only redheads.....haha.)  I mainly just wanted to sample their sushi....I've heard mixed things about this place so yeah.

I got the Loop Trolly (?) Roll. Except instead of fried shrimp (tempura) on the inside I asked specifically for non fried shrimp since I'm trying to cut back the calories/fat a bit. 

I don't think the menu mentioned anywhere that the roll had carrots in it too (not just cucumbers) and that they were going to drizzle a gallon of spicy mayo and eel sauce on top either (so much for cutting calories, haha. I had to scrape it all off.) It said it was topped with masago but there was barely any masago on it at all...just lightly on the sides of the roll like the way some places do to their California Rolls.

Anyway. Those discrepancies aside, it wasn't bad. Although the rice was kinda....""gummy""? It seemed like they pushed the rice down too hard when they were rolling up the roll. But maybe I am just getting picky/technical now? LOL.

Flavors were good but nothing to write home about. Nothing that other places haven't done before. So yeah. I did note that it's fairly cheap and those weren't just the lunch prices (I asked.) 

Service was pretty speedy too. I'd go back but I wouldn't make it a point to. Just if I happened to be in the area and wanted some cheap Asian food.

I'll order the pick 3 off of the dinner menu. Your choice of 3 tasty treats complete with rice and beans. While I waited for my dinner I munched on some light and airy tortilla chips dipped in a watery, tomato based salsa. They offer a meatier, chunky, hotter salsa that fares much better. Dinner arrives quickly and features a ""mini"" burrito, a cheese enchilada and a chicken tostada. The burrito was filled with tender beef chunks and still managed to be the smaller in size than the enchilada. Maybe it was an enchilada. Nope! The cheese enchilada didn't disappoint, but the sauce that covered the delicacy gave me terrible heartburn. The tostada was mess. Imagine a mountain of shredded lettuce covering salty chunk chicken over a soggy yellow corn tortilla (blame it on the refried bean spread). The side of red rice that accompanied the meal was ordinary while the refried beans were extraordinary. The beans and tortilla chips were the highlight of the meal.

So my wife and I decided to check it out one evening after a long day of running around doing errands. 

Well, from the moment we both walked in, the people there made us feel out of place. It was like a scene out of one of those movies where the needle scratches on the record and everyone looked at us like we were from the other side of the tracks or something. I've lived in New Orleans my whole life and I've never been somewhere where the locals look at me like I'm from Mars or something. (Not that there is anything wrong with Martians.) One gentleman grumbled under his breath right at the door and made some off color remark about my wife and I being there which I didn't really care for but for the sake not making a scene and giving the place a chance, we both ignored him. 

The bartender was really friendly and asked if we would like to see the bar menus which we did. The food there is reasonably priced and there is a lot to choose from. We both ordered burgers as well as two pints of Abita Amber. As we both drank our drinks and waited for our food, we turned around to watch the band play. Not sure what band they were but they seemed really good, it's just that no one was really interested in them. In some New Orleans bars, people move to the music. Even a nod of the head, at times. Not here. Everyone just kind of sat there in a trance just staring. Maybe because it was a Sunday night and people were dreading the upcoming Monday? Who knows. 

The food came out and it was fantastic. Burgers were cooked just right and seasoned to perfection. Our bartender even came to check if we were good which is definitely a plus. All in all, it was an alright experience, but I had kind of hoped the place would be rockin a little more than it was that night. Maybe we'll stop by again on a Friday or Saturday night.",2011-09-14 21:37:19

I was so hopeful when I walked into the place.  I thought I could find a way to rationalize a solid three star rating.  I just can't!

If it wasn't for a pretty cool ambiance and vibe, along with a stellar waitress (Sondra) this taco stand wouldn't even be worthy of the two stars I am giving it.

One of the guys I was with mentioned Cheap had some ""Supper Club"" promotion.  Apparently it's all you can eat and drink from a limited menu for $20.00.  You can't possibly go wrong with that, can you?  OOPS!  You can!!!

I am actually sitting here with the itemized bill in one hand, and the Cheap website page opened to the menu to figure out just what is was that I ate.

I started with the Spicy Tuna Roll ($6.00), and the Volcano Roll ($8.00).  The spicy tuna wasn't so spicy.  The volcano roll is served with ""dynamite sauce"".  The dynamite was a dud!  Sushi is one of those items where a mediocre product can be masqued by a well done plate presentation.  You would certainly expect at least that in a hip and trendy place in one of Tampa's hip and trendy nightspots, wouldn't you?  Not here.  It's not that the presentation was bad.  It was perfectly average.  Even the wasabe paste was bland!  How does that happen?!  On a scale of 5, the sushi earned a solid 2.3.

Next up, Bandarillas ($8.00).  The menu describes them as, ""Marinated Chicken Skewers, Grilled with Cannellini Beans"".  Marinated in what?!  The chicken was rubbery and flavorless.  The beans were okay.  The plate earned a generous 1.9.

Then came the Patatas Bravas ($4.00).  They are, ""Fried Potatoes, Aiolli and Spicy Brava Sauce"".  There may have been brava sauce on the plate.  It wasn't spicy.  That was aiolli?!  I'm working out the frustration, and feeling a bit kinder.  Let's give tham a 2.1.

Along came the Sliders (2) w/Shoestring Fries ($6.95).  Is there possibly a more flavorless frozen beef patty served anywhere in North America?  Doubtful.  My friend never even touched his.  We both agreed the fries were decent.  The patties earned the dish a 0.8.

With maybe 35-40 minutes left in my two hour spree, Sondra asked if she could bring me anything else.  All I could say was, ""I think I should stop now.""

So you're reading this and wondering, ""What the heck is he complaining about?  With drinks, he probably consumed $45-50.00 worth of stuff for $20.00"".  I know!  It sounds crazy, doesn't it?  How is it possible to feel so bent out of shape for all that fare?

Decor of the place is very fitting.  Left side of the store is more of a take out place where you can pick out your own crabs and place your order to go.

Our first visit was on a Saturday afternoon. It was only sparsely populated so we were able to get a seat at the bar. Bartenders were attentive and friendly. We struck up a conversation with one about their cocktails and the local spirits they use. We haven't tasted the cocktails yet but have had a chance to sample most of their current beers and haven't been disappointed. All were solid with no surprise stinkers in the group!

We had the cheese curds and the Nashville wings. The cheese curds were great and our very first experience with cheese curds at all since moving to Indy three months ago. Cheese? Good! Fried? Good! Dipping sauce? Good! Seemed like a win to us, but can't comment on how they compare to other local curds. We'll have to see in the future. As far as the wings, we found them to be meaty and juicy with secret heat (i.e. you finish a wing and then your mouth starts burning).

Our second stop in was around 9:30 on a Friday night. Much busier at that time so we checked out the upstairs, and despite the cold, the second floor porch overlooking the Monon (and Kroger as it were, but that's okay). It was fun to be outside for a little bit enjoying the crisp evening air and we know this is going to be an awesome summer spot once the warm weather comes around again. The upstairs bar cleared out by about 9:45/10 and we came inside to finish our beers.

Here are some of those things:
-This seems like the kind of place that puts more attention into presentation than taste.  
-Likewise, there seemed to be more attention to lots of interesting garnishes for each dish, rather than on the quality and taste of the core component.
-I wonder if they pick their staff the same way: our servers played the parts of a cool, hipster staff more than they delivered knowledgeable and welcoming service.

Here are the specifics:
-duck breast was over-smoked, and therefore was kind of one-dimensional
-I order trout every time I am in the midwest, because it is always better here than on the east coast, but when I ordered it last night.  It had very little flavor, and I didn't like the cook on it...to heavily fried rather than having the nice roasted quality I am used to
-panna cotta was quite beautiful and had great flavor, but the custard--if that is the right term--was grainy.
-the busser tried to clear our plates multiple times before we had finished, and the third time, I just capitulated and let him despite the fact I still had a mouth full of food.  (Why was I still eating if the food wasn't that good?  I eat slowly and am never really full when I am not really enjoying my food.)
-our waiters response to the question, ""what is the red ale like?"" was, ""it's a red ale.""

Here's what I liked:
-every part of the succotash, though it is notable that we shared this as an app because there really weren't many other starters we were excited about
-the french onion soup.  lovely.
-the mosel riesling; can't remember the last time I had such a good glass of wine for $7...

...which brings me to value.  Portion sizes were fine, and the preps justified higher prices, but the taste of the meats did not.  Also, for $30 entrees, I expect my table to be crumbed after the entrees.

Decor was nice, but the light above our table flicker most of the meal, and it was too cold half of our meal and too warm the other half.

Too many issues to be any more generous than 2 stars.",2014-11-27 16:59:51

Came with a big party on a Sunday for lunch.  Ordered the ahi tacos and a nikka cioppino.  Total came out to be about $35.  When I had ordered the ahi tacos, I specified for two sauces- a house one for one taco and a Chipotle for another taco.  I also got the side of salad with sesame dressing. When the tacos came out, I was missing the Chipotle sauce.  I was also missing the dressing for my salad.  Although there was quite a bit of fish in my tacos, the fish was unevenly cooked.  Some of the fish was perfectly seared, while other pieces were tough and overcooked.

My friend who got the seared ahi burger received his fish well done and it had to be sent back.  

The nikka cioppino came in a tomato broth and was delicious and flavorful.  It did have pieces of small licorice or something that tasted like that within the broth (which I wasn't so fond of).  While eating it, my friend who also ordered the same cioppino mentioned that hers was missing king crab legs and scallops in it.   I looked at mine and it didn't have either of those either.  We checked the chalk menu inside the restaurant and the printed menu, and sure enough- the cioppino was supposed to have those two seafood items.  We bring it up to the waiter.  A different worker comes out and explains that there was a problem with the distributor for the king crab legs and they sold out of scallops a couple of days ago (but that they had given us extra seafood to compensate for it).  Normally, this wouldn't be a big issue for me- but I feel like they handled it all wrong.   If someone orders something from your menu and you run out of certain items for that dish, shouldn't you inform the customer about the changes ahead of time??!? The explanation also sounded ""fishy"" (get it? :P) since my friend had ordered a fried cod/scallop appetizer and he received it.

I didn't chose to go here but was brought with family. Normally these touristy, loud places do not appeal to me. We arrived by boat so we came through the area where they transfer fresh fish from their catch. I like the idea of eating actually freah, hardly transported fish. But that's about the only thing I liked. 

Our server was inattentive and only came to take our orders and deliver them. He never came by to check up and we had to signal him down not once, but three times to make comments about our orders. 

We ordered the full order of cold boiled shrimp  that were slightly mushy and came with only one small, half filled souffle cup of cocktail sauce. What are you supposed to do with that amount of of cocktail sauce, 5 people, and at least 20 shrimp? That was our first attempt to wave down our waiter to ask for more, who didn't come over until much later when we were more than half way done eating it (it wasn't just going to sit there) and graciously brought us another small half-filled souffle cup to torment us. By the way, the order came with ONE single packet for wet wipes for the entire table. 

We also ordered the ""famous smoked fish spread"" which seemed a lot like a pile of mediocre tuna fish with some celery. It was even served with pre packaged saltine crackers. It was offensive and I wish that I took a picture of it but I did not want to offend my family. 

I ordered the almond encrusted snapper salad over a small bed of salad mix, 5 halves of a strawberry, a light sprinkle of feta cheese, and 4 thin slivers of red onion. Not impressed. The only positive I have about that was the portion of fish, which was larger than I was expecting. 

Seafood quesadillas were below average. Not sure who in their right mind would order a quesadilla stuffed with seafood and cheese, but my parents did. Menu states it was served with sour cream and salsa, but instead it came with some wilted iceburg lettuce and tomato. Couldn't taste the tequila citrus marinade. The biggest flavor in the quesadilla was the cheese.

The plates that the food was served on were identical to my college's dining hall. Besides the awful tye-dye ones. Those my school did not have. 

I have never left a review like this before, but I was not impressed. 2 stars because it was at least edible and I didn't leave half way through. I'm not sure if we just had a really bad experience because the place was packed, or if everyone dining there just has low standards.

I ordered the Chicken Curry Naan-wich (I love bready things and the naan caught my attention immediately). Overall, the food was fun, flavorful, and creative--I liked the fusions of different cuisines throughout the menu. However, among the dozen or so dishes our party ordered, there was a huge variation in portion size from The Big Bang to the Seared Tuna that couldn't really be predicted from the menu. 

The Naan-wich came with the Continental Salad (there was also a choice of fruit). The naan itself was heavenly--soft, warm, and a little buttery..The filling contained tender chunks of chicken and had a hint of sweetness that paired well with the naan. The salad was also good, and the amount of dressing (oil and vinegar) wasn't overpowering. I really appreciated the hardy amount of salad, and the sandwich is nice and filling.

They give your table warm, slightly salted tortilla chips to start and a jar of salsa that you can pour into a little bowl. The salsa isn't spicy, which is good for me. Yum.

EXCITED. So we gave it a try. We need to call him and find out what's going on in that head of his. Or maybe there's been a huge issue with the second location? 

We went to the counter and ordered. I'm always a little irritated when a counter service place asks for tip before you've even had any service, and the lowest grat offered on their Clover POS was 15%. To be clear, all they're doing is running food out, and we generally don't tip food runners. But okay. 

There issues with the POS system and the owner/manager had to get a little tutorial from the girl working the other station. But it took us a little time to order. We ordered a Bayou Crepe, a Hangover, and, since there was no signage in the bakery case, had to do a bit of pointing and ""no, what's this one?"" to figure out what was in there. (PS everything was banana nut bread.) We ordered a little banana nut flat cake thing (not a loaf) and took our number and went to our table. Asked for waters while we waited so felt better about that 15% tip. 

We were right by the door and ended up moving. It was clearly clean the patio day and mops and squeegees were coming in and going out. I love cleaning, but it was just a lot of traffic. 

Food came out fast, and as it turns out, too fast. My Bayou Crepe, a crepe filled with crab augratin, came out first and I let it hang for a minute while my husband's food came out. Coffees came out in paper cups. Husband's Hangover arrived, and this savory waffle topped with grits, scrambled eggs, and soy sausage looked gorgeous. The gentleman who had rung us up delivered the waffle and said ""enjoy!"" and we had to ask for the banana nut thing. So no one is expediting. But apparently, no one is actually cooking either. 

This food was microwaved. The crepe, despite the pan marks, was not crisp anywhere. Not on the pan marks, not on the edges. It was soggy, like a gas station burrito. The flavor of the filling was incredible, but the disappointment in the consistency wasn't something I could get past. My husband's waffle had crisp looking brown edges and they were just soggy too. We don't know if the food is cooked at the original location and then brought over just to be heated here (there is a Waffles on Maple van parked out front that would work great for this), but it's a shame.  The flavor in everything was quite good but there was no texture - it was just hot glop. And I don't mind a bowl of stew but not when I've ordered a waffle or a crepe. I also don't mind paying $40 for breakfast but that stings when it's not made fresh.  

The banana bread was no better. The walnuts tasted old and we didn't come close to finishing it. Cafe at lait was just non-chicory coffee with cream and the cappuccino was a latte. 

It was like eating in the airport. Everything sounds amazing, the place looks cool, but seating is tight, food is cooked off site and microwaved, and is overpriced for what you actually get. We won't be back, but are quite curious about the other location.",2017-04-03 16:35:25

Went with a host of family members with varying levels of pickiness, so I will say in their favor that their menu is so extensive that there was certainly something for everyone. Started with the spinach-queso appetizer which was essentially undersalted cheese with an occasional spinach leaf that would surface after much digging (though it was served with a little dollop of some surprisingly good guac, which WASN'T EXTRA - take that, Chipotle!). Then four of us split two of the 2-for-1 meal options + a Caesar salad, so a pretty good deal financially: the ribs were tender and sweet, the salmon with its teriyaki glaze was fine, the sirloins weren't as bad as I expected, the broccoli was soggy but had a nice zing to it, the mashed potatoes were good, and the lemon soy Brussels sprouts were actually quite yummy (but cost extra, and their accompanying ""crispy"" croutons were soggy). I also ordered a cup of French onion soup, which was one of my faves from childhood, but it was horrendous - effectively lukewarm brown water, utterly tasteless, requiring maybe a solid minute of grinding away at the sea salt shaker before it became palatable - this was not the soup I remembered. The manager was kindly receptive to this criticism and graciously took it off our bill.

The plate that came out was straight up tentacles, little suction cups and all. I'm not used to eating gummy legs unless they're fried, you can call me amateur, but it grossed me out right away. Anyway, when I clamped my teeth down for a chew the leg shot from one side of my mouth to the other. It was so hard and inflexible. I gave it another chance, chewed again, and the same thing happened. I could not make a dent in the thing. So I spit it out into my napkin (which I never do). A friend I was with advised me that the technique was to simply swallow and not chew...my theory is, if you have to swallow food like a pill, maybe it's just not edible.

We arrived at 5:48 pm on Saturday and were seated promptly.  By the time 6 pm rolled around, nobody had come to our table.  We decided we'd give them until 6:10 before we left.  at 6:05 a fairly large table was sat on the other side of the table.  I decided to keep an eye on them and see if their server went to their table.  They did - almost immediately.  While we still sat there with our menus and nothing else.  Our server finally came over to take our drink order at 6:09 (20 full minutes after getting to our table) - she was friendly enough but really had zero personality and seemed unaware that we had waited so long, although I had seen her walking around in the restaurant while we waited.  We placed all our orders.

I got the chicken sandwich with no onions, bf got the fried chicken meal, and the teenager got the half rack of ribs.  The 2 stars are for the chicken sandwhich and the ribs, which were fine.  oh!  and we got a cup of clam chowder which was pretty tasty.

The main issues were with the corn on the cob that comes with the fried chicken meal.  As soon as the plate was placed on the table, my boyfriend asked if he could have new corn.  I've included a picture to show the weird mushy brown corn that he was given.  She said ok and went back to the kitchen.  She didn't ask what was wrong, or offer any apologies.  It took quite a while for the replacement corn to arrive.  When our server brought it back, she said ""here's some more corn for you"" and left the bad corn on the table (we had removed it from his plate and put it on one of the side plates that we were given for some reason).  the new corn didn't have the same mushy brown spots, but he only had 2 bites of it.  It was cold and hard and unappetizing overall.    The server checked on us once, when she brought the replacement corn, but not again after that.

I did try to get the attention of the gentleman walking around in the button up shirt, because he appeared to be an authority figure, but I couldn't flag him down.

It was very dry and tasted way too earthy.  I'm saying that to be polite... it tasted like dirt.  So obviously I didn't eat any of that.  I'll go with potatoes next time.

We managed to save room for dessert at the end and went with the dessert trio, as it gave us a chance to try out a couple of things.  It included the raspberry creme brulee, the rum cake, and the chocolate souffle.  I'm a sucker for creme brulee and this was one of the best I've had.

""Whoa! Chill your donut hole!"" I replied, in my head. She proceeds to ring us up and disregards the fourth person with us. She rolls her eyes and doesn't apologize.

Anyway, for my wife, the first bite of her glazed chocolate was what made her smile. I take a bite of my jalapeño and cheese croissant and was bummed when it didn't have the heat nor the crisp.

All the food is on display and they cook it to order. I selected two slices of pizza, grabbed my mom a plain cheese slice, and then selected a couple desserts for us.

The checkout area looks like it would be self service, but it's not.

Both pizza slices I had were pretty bland. The four cheese tasted and looked like a plain white. Hardly caught any pronounced cheese notes. The chicken and broccoli alfredo was stacked high but the quality didn't match. My mom said the plain cheese slice was nothing to write home about as well.

For dessert, I was told the coconut snowball wasn't great at all. The chocolate lava cake was pretty decent warmed up though.

I feel like this would be a great place for group outings or kids birthday parties. They base their business model off sensory overload and flashiness. There are plenty of seats -- so much so that it looks like a cafeteria.

We are not experts on Brazilian food, I have only been in Brazil twice and ate more churrasco.  Our friends who lived there and co-workers from there, preferred Café Brazil.  

I like the atmosphere, very homey.  It was not busy at all for a Saturday night, but we were early by Brazilian standards.  Ms T and I started off with some decent Empanadas Camarao.  They were piping hot and had a creamy filling that had some tartness with the cream.  The shrimp were flavorful.

Ms T ordered the Xin Xim de Galinha.  This comprised two chicken breasts in a creamy coconut milk sauce with some shrimp thrown in.  It had a little chile heat and was excellent over the rice.  I had the Lombo Ipanema, which was pan seared slices of pork loin with pineapple.  It had a tangy rich pan sauce from the pork and fruit.  It was served with black beans over rice and some potato salad.  All were very good.  The pork was tender, moist and flavorful.  One slice was thinner and slightly over done, but all in all it was very good.  I love simple black beans and rice and these fit my taste.  I also liked the style of potato salad with mayo and whole grain mustard. (not sweet, no Miracle Whip).  Farofa was also part of the pork dish.  I have to admit I don't ""get"" farofa and don't usually eat much of it.  

Both were very large servings and we brought food home.  I would definitely go back and would take friends.  Both dishes would be re-orders but there are certainly more good things to try.  I will say the salad Ms T had and the carrot soup (of-the-day) I had were not anything special.  My soup was barely warm and pretty plain.  The main courses made up for it.  I also liked the iced tea which was smoky, somehow.",2011-05-09 19:07:16

After a couple of trips to the West Coast (Seattle and Portland) we fell in love with the teriyaki that is everywhere out there.  We have been looking in St Louis for that style and have not found it.  Ms T is not a raw fish eater, so Ocha is a good choice because of the Thai offerings.  This time she tried the teriyaki chicken and found it to be the same as the previous two places (Fuji Sushi and Sushi House.  None of it is worth ordering.  Again, she had a dry piece of grilled chicken breast with some bottled teriyaki sauce on top.  Apparently the style of doing Teriyaki that is West Coast, has not translated to St Louis.  This is simply, not good.  So lesson learned, I think we are done trying.

We shared Thai Potstickers in Panang curry.  These were very good.  I liked that the Panang curry was not overly sweet.  I ordered an Angel Roll again as well as nigiri of yellowtail, tuna and sea bass.  They were out of sea bass, but all of the others were very good.  

I am not a reliable judge of sushi, but I like this place, although I doubt if I could distinguish it from others.  I recommend against the teriyaki.  I will stay with three stars until Ms T gets a Thai meal that she likes.",2015-02-08 12:48:02

Finally, nearly a year later, Ms T and I joined the D's here for Saturday night dinner.  We were excited to dine here since we are fans of Sidney Street Café.  We took a good bottle of wine, corkage is $10.

Jax is a nice little place on a corner in the Benton Park neighborhood.  Parking can be a bit of a problem because it is street.  We were able to get within a couple of blocks.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  Our wine was opened and we just ordered the Fried Asparagus as an appetizer since we had already had a nice starter at the D's house.  The asparagus was breaded and deep fried with some mozzarella and served with an aioli.  It was the best part of the meal after the wine.

Ms D and Ms T both ordered a Chicken Breast that was served over couscous.  The chicken was very plain, pretty much unseasoned, relatively tasteless and generally uninspired.  Ms D and I liked the couscous though, which included some cherry tomatoes and an occasional raisin.

I grew up eating fresh walleye from fishing trips to Minnesota.  I have always said that it is fish for people who don't like fish.  So I almost ordered it, but had my mind made up for the Teres Major.  Mr D did order the Walleye and was underwhelmed.  I was picturing a nice filet, paneed to a golden color.  He received three small cross-cut slices with skin on that just looked steamed to me.  when I saw it, I was glad I did not order it, however.......

My Teres Major was not really any better.  I am a fan of beef chuck; braised, roasted and ground for burgers and meat loaf.  It is about all I buy.  I was hungry for a steak and decided to try this trendy, cool steak, taken from the chuck and purported to be the second-most tender muscle on the beef.  It was cooked properly (medium rare).  It was not really tough, but certainly could not be called tender.  I had some difficulty cutting it and it was what I would call, solid.  Chuck, even the teres major, just does not work well as a steak no matter what the chefs are pushing.  The bigger issue was that this was unseasoned and the meat tasted sour.  I don't think they touted it as grass-fed, but I wondered.  It just was not well flavored.  It was served with baked beans, a huge serving of overly creative, ill-conceived baked beans, made of all things, with red kidney beans.  Nothing should be made with red kidney beans.  This was heavy, sweet and sour and loaded with onion and a few of those raisins again.  I barely touched the beans.  I really wanted the oyster mushroom Bordelaise and dirty mashed potatoes that they listed on the menu on-line.  (they don't maintain their menu up-to-date on their website).  The final accompaniment was some corn bread that I can safely say was the worst I have ever eaten.  It was somehow powdery-floury, like it was made from corn flour rather than corn meal and the flour was not all wetted.  This also did not get eaten.

All the way around the table, we were underwhelmed and even disappointed.  It is not often that all four of us get meals we would not order again, in a place like this.  When we walked in, I was expecting so much more from Jax.  I had visions of taking Bro J and TT there.  The menu reads much better than the food.  Our service was fine but the chef missed the mark both in concept and in execution.  Apparently this might be a better place for the Sunday brunch.",2015-08-28 13:15:07

Hendricks continues to do a great business and may be the only barbecue game in the close local area.  They were busy and I recommend reservations for a Saturday.

We managed a free appetizer based on a Yelp instant coupon that came with check-in.  For this we tried shrimp and grits.  Having just returned from the North Carolina coast, I can't say that the shrimp had the most flavor, but I liked how they were prepared with a lot of coarse black pepper and a nice sauce over the top of some very cheesy and creamy grits.  I could see splitting this with Ms T again if we return.

The L's both ordered fried chicken and received huge portions along with two sides each.  The chicken looked nearly burned to me and the breast meat looked dry.  I'm not sure I would order fired chicken here based on the appearance of what they received.

I stuck with a Pick Two this time based on the Whole Shebang sampler from last time that allowed me to rule out turkey and sausage.  I also ruled out pulled pork since knew Ms T would get it.  I selected brisket and St Louis cut ribs.  I have to say the meats were fine but maybe not up to my original four stars.  The brisket was OK, a little dry and actually plenty salty.  This was pretty much the same as the previous visit.  The ribs were not as good.  I just had the impression that the meats were not particularly fresh on this night.  They did not taste stale, that is, old, but they were not wonderful.  Lately I have been having significantly better at Sugar Fire.

I still liked my collards.  I avoided the horrible pureed onion slaw having learned my lesson last time.  Ms T had more cheddar grits and baked beans.  Both were decent.  The potato salad is made with small cubes of potato.  I liked the mayo dressing for not being sweet or mustardy, but the potato was undercooked and nearly crunchy.

This place stinks. It's in a great location - huge space. The host was quick to seat me and friendly. The waiter was kind but didn't come around much.

For $8 I got an enchilada that was about 5 inches long - it was like a mini enchilada. The plate said it came with ""lime vegetables"" - they were sliced, raw carrots that tasted like nothing. The rice was bland and the beans were runny. Everything was wrong. I ate almost nothing on my plate and the waiter did not ask if anything was wrong. I could have told him - but judging by my friend's plate in not sure that anything else would have been much better. If I go back it would be to try a margarita.",2015-03-05 03:18:44

I picked this restaurant because of the positive reviews and went there last night with out of town friends. I was EMBARRASSED that I recommended this restaurant to them. While I understand that Covid has affected the restaurant industry, we should not have experienced the following:

I made a reservation for 6:30. I kept calling to add one more person to the reservation and they didn't answer the phone each time I called so I left a message but they never checked their answering service. I got a text at 5:55 that my table was ready and it turned out that they thought the reservation was for 5:00. I wasn't even at the restaurant yet.

When we arrived and sat down we asked for water and were told they don't don't provide water to their guests. You have to purchase a bottle of water for $4. That's $24  for water for 6 people! I have never in my life had a restaurant flat out refuse to put tap water into a cup when they're serving people dinner. 

One person in our party only ordered an entree and asked that it not be served until after our appetizers and they brought it to him twice before everyone else's dinner was served. He sent it back each time. When we got to the entrees, his food wasn't hot and he asked if this was just the same food that had been sitting. He was told that they had boxed up the other entree for take out and this was a fresh one. But they didn't give us the other entree, so ""boxed up for takeout"" apparently means that after trying to serve him the food twice they boxed it up and sold it to someone else. 

The waitress' accent was very hard to understand and even harder through a mask. Her attitude was nonchalant and she did not seem to care about the issues we were experiencing.

My friend ordered a salad and didn't realize that it  came with her dinner so we asked the waitress if she would remove the charge and appropriate it as the salad that came with her dinner and she refused to do so. She said that she had already put the charge in the computer and it would be too much trouble to fix it.

The food was not very good. I have had much better and fresher tasting sushi. A lot of their rolls are made with chopped up fish instead of whole pieces which is cheaper for them but their prices don't reflect that. My son's chicken teriyaki was over cooked and the sauce was burned onto the bottom of the serving dish.

After I got home I felt very nauseous and since I hadn't eaten since breakfast I can only attribute that to the food.

When it was time to pay the bill, the waitress asked for the credit card without even bringing a check. I had to ask to see the check rather than just handing my card over for whatever they wanted to charge. 

It seems like everything this restaurant does is an attempt to save money or overcharge. They don't provide physical menus even if you ask for one, they charge for water, $1.50 for a little spicy sauce, using the chopped fish, refusing to count the salad as the salad that came with my friend's dinner, etc.

I recently read a book Franklin's BBQ, that describes how difficult it is to run a BBQ restaurant. And I know some places in Central Texas, i.e. Kreutz Market, got away for years with having people wait in two lines, not having any decent sides, and just getting by on the meat. But that's not the kind of Place Johnnie Macks is trying to be, and so I have to review it on what I got.

I went on a Sunday about noon. My favorite BBQ joint only serves M-F lunch, so I went looking for another place and found Johnnie Mack's was open. There was one table occupied, and one guy waiting for take-out. The restaurant is a tad dark, and I ordered and then sat by a window. The table was clean. There is salt, pepper, and Tabasco sauce on the table, and that's it. 

The young guy taking the order was in his teens and was very pleasant and professional. I asked about sausage, not seeing it on the menu, and was told it was no longer sold. So I went with the 4 rib plate, which was very low priced - about $10.  And a can of soda, reasonable at 85 cents, but no cups or ice available. No napkins or sauces on the table reminded me that I was not in a very nice part of town, and they likely have had past problems with vagrants eating up the profits in sauce and napkins. The nearby McDonald's likewise operates on the conservative.

The ribs and the potato salad arrived first, and I was told that the mac and cheese would be right out. The ribs were four large spare ribs, cooked well, and like it or not, covered with sauce in the kitchen. To me, that would be okay if the sauce were cooked on the meat, but this was sauce applied just before the ribs came out. That sauce should be on the side. It was tasty enough, but nothing so good I would definitely want it in every bite. The four ribs were generously sized, and I almost couldn't eat them all.  The meat was tender and tasty.

Not to be gross, but I ended up burping up a rank smoked smell and taste for the rest of the day and well into the evening. I don't ever recall eating lunch, and later eating dinner, and then after that burping up the smell of lunch. Reading some other reviews about the wood or starter fluid (if they use it, which would surprise me) makes me think something was off for my meal. I doubt seriously that would happen to me again, but I am making note of it to see if it does.

The potato salad was okay. Mix mustard and mayo, and toss in the potatoes, maybe onion, and that's roughly what you have.

The mac and cheese was a disappointment, and I didn't eat it. I tried a bite, then another bite which came with a hunk of gristly pork that I had to spit out. I decided the flavor was off. I don't know what the wait was on it, either, as it came out lukewarm five minutes into my meal. The mac and cheese did not look like that pictured by other reviewers.

The attendant who took away my plate noticed I didn't eat it, and I told him I wasn't that hungry anyway. I was amazed at someone's noticing! Lately most waiters just take away the uneaten food without even noticing whether an item was clearly not enjoyed, which I find to be careless. So I give the young man points for taking note.

Most of these comments have been said before, and if this restaurant has such a line out the door at other times, I have to assume my experience is a bit of an outlier on the negative side. That said, comments like mine have appeared from several rational-sounding reviewers, and I hope they can help the restaurant improve and stay in business as we don't have many BBQ places locally. Here's hoping they get to consistent 4 and 5 stars in 2015.",2015-07-21 16:10:43

The brisket ramen had a delicious flavor with the red chile broth, the matzo was perfect, but my brisket had a huge vein of fat in it and there were only two thin slices of it; for a steep $14+tax, I wasn't even full. 

Someone else has it right that this is a dive bar meets ramen joint, which should turn out to be a good, charming thing. However, you typically feel good for that value you get for your money at a dive bar, yet most ramen joints are inherently overpriced.

It's a cute place, but the room here is tight, with very few tables; so you are probably going to sit at the bar, squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder while feeling cramped in an awkward situation with others. At least our visit was not in the middle of a mad rush of diners, and we could relax.

Cheu is ""A-OK"" (3 stars) for an occasional treat, but it's a stretch to be a ""huge fan"".",2016-03-18 11:07:19

This isn't the biggest Wawa in town, but it has the most modern design - with the greenish-glass tiled walls.

The checkout area has a ton of registers, which should help during those busy times - it just depends how many employees will be in the store to assist at those times.

We will see how long the 24x7 hours stick, being just several blocks away from a Center City flagship Wawa that had to limit its hours due to in-store violence. And probably the worse design move: placing the restrooms just inside the entrance doors, which is just screaming to invite some of the rougher street crowds that hang out in this area.

I think it would be better as a side item. As far as the grilled cheese and tomato soup, the soup was more like a marinara than a soup. Not very tasty. The grilled cheese was ok.

The Gravois Champagne Cocktail: it was okay... pretty much just tasted like plain ole champagne. 

A glass of red wine. I don't remember which one, but it was the cheapest option and he poured me a HUGE glass. No complaints :)

A bottle of Scrimshaw. Sort of like Budweiser. Don't be afraid of it just because it has a fancy name/bottle. 

 Lamb chops with carrot puree and mashed potatoes. I wasn't crazy about the sides, but man, those lamb chops. Delicious.

Really enjoyed my Valentines/Anniversary dinner here. Food was so delicious, we had the Supreme I think that is what it is called. It included Filet Mignon, Lobster, Shrimp, Chicken Teriyaki.

I ordered an AMF and my husband had a Long Island. Both were perfect, like probably one of the best AMF's I have had. The Long Island was good but I think Cheesecake Factory's Long Island is better. 

The show was very fun, our chef was really good and entertained the group well. 

The Shrimp Appetizer was really good as well as the Calamari rings. So flavorful. The meal came with a seafood dipping sauce, a meat dipping sauce, soy ginger sauce, and a hot mustard sauce.

We also added fried rice to ours, which was really good too. Full of flavor. 

Meat was cooked according to how we wanted it, so tender and juicy. Lobster was really good. Shrimp was SO good. Chicken teriyaki SOOO GOOD. 

Overall it was so worth it. We paid a total of $150 for two people with Supreme and two drinks with fried rice for both of us. It was delicious, so fun and so worth it. Its definitely something you should try out. We loved our teppanyaki dinner!",2012-02-21 01:16:40

Sauce was delicious, fresh mozzarella for the cheese, perfection on a pizza. We loved it. For appetizers we ordered a small HUGE Caesar salad (no raw eggs in the dressing btw) and a small plate of antipasto, really yummy! Salad had the crispness and the antipasto was delicious really enjoyed it a lot. 

For dessert we had the seductive mouth watering tiramisu and their ""famous"" canoli, both exceeded our expectations. Glad to know this place is two blocks from where I live.

The only downfall I would say is that they charge when you add toppings, (cheese and sauce is already included) but anything else you want on there is anywhere from $2-5

Between then and now, it's become quite popular and one of the best bars this side of the city.  So the owners decided to spread the wealth and  go to the other side.  The result: Local 44.

Local 44 is a pretty standard bar that focuses of serving up good beer and food.  It's clearly run by the folks from Memphis, as evident by the  similar menu and beer selection.  There are about eighteen beers on tap, including the beer engine, which gives beer drinkers of any persuasion a good choice.

Beer selection aside, the rest of the experience is average.  The service was acceptable; not great.  The prices are average.  The atmosphere is nice, but forgettable.  The only real reason to go to Local 44 is just that, if it's your local spot.  You won't be seeing me make the trip from Fishtown again.

Downsides: The bar charges tax on beer, which is lame, but not unheard of.  Beers that would be $4-$7 are suddenly $4.40 to $7.70.  Even with the tax, the prices are still acceptable.  I was having trouble deciding the beer I wanted, so I asked for a sample.  The barkeep shot back that they ""don't do samples, because that's how [they] keep the prices so low.""  I didn't think that was true, or a good reason for denying me an ounce of beer.  It's not breaking your bank.

Bottom Line: This place is fine. If you happen to be around, check it out. It's not going to crack the top ten or even top twenty list of Philadelphia bars, but it will do just fine and continue to serve up good food and beers.",2009-03-05 16:53:12

We were so happy to find out that Yokos is owned by JAPANESE and you can tell the difference when you eat the food. The lot can get packed since they share a parking with another popular restaurant and several other stores. And if you go during prime dinner time, there will likely be a wait inside. But why 2 stars?

First off, for our first time here we had about 8 people and we spent close to $400 here. We ordered several rolls on the menu, sashimi and several appetizers. They were all excellent. 

Now, the service. When we got to Yokos, there was a thunderstorm outside and they just opened for the night. I wrote everything down on the order form they give you so that the waitress wouldn't get confused. But she did and several our orders came out wrong. We didn't want cream cheese on any of our rolls and a few of the rolls I requested no avocado and to have cucumber instead since someone is allergic. We still got all of them, even though I neatly wrote it down. Mind you this is also after we waited almost 60 minutes for our food (even though we were one of the first orders placed). The waitress had our orders remade, which then took an additional 30 minutes. So half the table was starving. And another person at the table didn't get their udon until AFTER we were almost done with our food so they had to watch us eat. Drinks were always empty, we had to constantly ask them to be refilled.

Eventually I asked to speak with the manager. In the waitresses defense, the owners told us that 1) the waitress was new, and 2) the power briefly went out for a short time and their order system got messed up. Ok so I get it. So to make up for the food taking so long and the horrible experience, one owner told us that she would take the orders that came out wrong off our check and we wouldn't get charged for them. BUT THEN GET THIS, another owner then came after and told us that we were only not going to be charged for wrong rolls and the bill stayed the same (well DUH, we shouldn't be charged for the food half the table can't eat), and then she asked us is we wanted ice cream. So they never took anything off the bill. We spent close to $400 there, had TERRIBLE service and the wrong food come out, and they couldn't take off the $30 worth of rolls for their own mistake.

Okay, since the food was good, we tried Yokos again and ordered about $200 worth of take out for a group of us. My husband and nephew went to pick up the food and brought it home. When they got home there was no soy sauce or spicy mayo in the bags (when I asked for it over the phone). So he went back and let my nephew run in to the restaurant to get the sauce (everyone knows that parking lot fills up). They gave him soy sauce but wanted to charge for the spicy mayo. He explained that we just had the big order but they still wanted to charge for the sauce. Since my nephew is just a kid, he didn't have money and just left. When you spend over $200 on food, shouldn't they give you the $1 or $2 spicy mayo for free? It's not like I just got a bento box.

It's such a shame because the food is good (3/4 stars). I'm sure they do well and have lots of regular customers. I'm happy for them. But for us, I guess we were unlucky with service (1 star). These instances left a sour taste in my mouth and we will likely not be going back.",2018-09-17 16:02:28

- BYOB. Those 4 letters say it all. Oh, and if you forget your bottle, they'll offer you house wine. 
- Friendly Staff. Our waiter here was beyond friendly when we interacted with him. Since we were seated in the back, I felt like he forgot about us at times. 
-Dessert. Yum, Yum, Yum. The Tarfufo was delicious and so was the chocolate moose. 

The Bad:

So let me tell you guys about my horrible experience, I had at TGI Fridays, on this Sunday night. I just wanna say, I have never felt so unwanted as a customer, in my life, than i have felt tonight by the staff of the TGI Fridays at this location. So I've been craving the Sizzling Chicken an Cheese plate, been thinking about it all day, just knew i was going there, and having this for dinner. So we arrived at 10pm, it says their open till midnight. The hostess at the door, tells us that the dining area is closed, and we can sit at the bar. she wasn't very friendly or informative, nor did she guide us, or give us menus. So we sit at the bar for about 5 minutes and steal a menu from the other end of the bar.  The bartender, Chelsea,  approaches us, and she informs us that the kitchen had just closed, and we won't be able to place a food order. We were bummed and stated that we weren't here for the drinks, we specifically came here to eat, so we start to grab our keys and leave. She stops us, and says ""Well wait, let me check with the kitchen, maybe we can still squeeze your order in"" So she comes back, and gives us the green light. we place our order, she puts it in. After about five minutes after that. I see her again, and ask for a soda, and his drink. So we sit there for about 30 minutes, then she goes and checks on it, and comes back with a bag of To-Go food. Like my jaw dropped. just utter dissapointment, She states well i didn't know you wanted it for here. I clearly stated i was her to eat.  Like are you serious? did I ask for a to go order? How could you assume something like that? That could've easily been cleared up with a question, if you had any thought on it. Like I ordered a Sizzling dish, the point is to have it brought to me sizzling on a cast iron plate. The meal looked so un appealing in the to-go container, there was pretty much no cheese in the dish, and what they did have in there was burnt to a cheese crisp that was at the bottom of the container. The mashed potatoes was just blah, absolutely no flavor, and tasted like they were instant mashed potatoes. 
 Not only did the food lack, i ate my dish at the bar with plastic utensils, out of the plastic containers. The bartender had no interest in taking the food back and properly plating it and serving it to us, once she found out that she had  made a mistake. She simply drops off 2 small side plates and some silverware. Like we're supposed to  take the food out of the containers and re-plate it, if we wish to eat here. My boyfriend was entirely pissed off, he didn't even try to eat his food, he simply took the togo container and stuck it in the togo bag, and waited on me to finish my meal. Honestly whats the point of saying your open till midnight, if your going to start closing 2 hours before that, and be busy doing closing jobs, that distract you from providing full service to the remaining guest that are trying to enjoy the establishment. So that was how i spent my Sunday night, getting treated like shit at TGI Fridays. All i wanted was some good service and some good food. Its clear that neither of those can be found at this location of TGI Fridays. Im sad to say this experience was so bad that i don't think i will ever return to any Fridays location, ever.",2016-03-14 05:08:49

Food is expensive in The Quarter, so although the prices seem high, they are reasonable for the area.  Not much of a Mart, but the sandwich and plate dinner choices are many and delicious.

Either the hostess staff isn't paying attention or they need a better system. 

I gave them three stars because it is a decent eating spot but there was nothing that really made it memorable for me. The sheer proximity to the cycling class is what brought me here and the price. I can not deny the price of the food vs the hugge portion is a big plus! This is a good 3 star spot! Middle of the road is not bad!

Square One is a solid restaurant, bar, and distillery in the Lafayette Square area.  I came here a little while ago with some friends to enjoy dinner and a few beers, and I think the four of us mutually decided it was a pretty solid, 3-star, ""A-OK"" experience.

It's a nice atmosphere inside, even if it's a bit confusing at first figuring out where to go if you want a table (the hostess is at a stand at the back of the first room).  The huge glass windows reveal showcase brewing equipment stockpiled in the corners, and see-through floor panels reveal barrels and casks in the basement.  The noise isn't too bad at all, and the patio area does look pretty nice, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.

Our friendly, down-to-business waitress started us off with a round of beers.  I tried the Pilsner, which was pretty decent; my friends gave the sampler and a few other types a shot.  I think we were all happy with the taste of the unique beer.

The food, though, was, again, A-OK.  I think I might have been the happiest with the ""Wurst Plate""-- a selection of sausages with spicy mustard over mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.  A friend reported the fish and chips were ""okay, but nothing special,"" and a buddy liked the ribs but not the side, sweet potatoes and pecans.  The seared tuna sandwich was a no-go, described as ""dry and not too tasteful.""

I definitely feel, though, that the food and beer were both solid, with neither detracting from the other.  The value was pretty good, too, with plenty of sandwiches under $10.00.  The sausage plate was about $16 and the beers ran around $4.25 each.

Would I come back to Square One?  Not living too close, it doesn't seem like it'd be in my regular rotation, but it's definitely a location to keep in mind for those that want a reliable and accessible microbrewery venue for catching up with friends.  Looking forward to coming back eventually to see if my opinion changes, but for now, Square One's on the St. Louis B-list.",2010-05-11 04:15:09

Grbic has been on my bookmark list as far back as I can remember, so we decided to finally try it.  I tried not to get my expectations too high, since some of the reviews mentioned the food being bland.

For us it was good, but not anything amazing.   We had chicken Jaeger Schnitzel and another special summer chicken dish that had chicken, various veggies and spaetzle baked in a dish.  We also had the cevapi appetizer.   The cevapi had the taste of a really good grilled hamburger, but in the shape of a breakfast sausage link.   They were good, but we didn't care for the sauce that came with it.  My wife called it perfectly, it tasted like thousand island dressing with a kick.   The spaetzle that came with both entrees was good - it reminded me of Germany.  These are little scrappy, pea-size chunks of pasta.   No doubt they are made in-house.  The flavor of the dishes was good, again, but neither of us was floored.   

To go with our dinner, we got a bottle of Romanian Pinot Noir, whic neither of us liked.  It interesting that all their wines by the glass are Californian, but by the bottle, they're all Romanian.  This gave me very little confidence that the wines by the glass were a good idea.  This whole wine experience would probably keep us from coming back. I will say the bottle was very reasonably priced at $24.  

We saw maybe 6 people come in to eat while we were there on a Saturday night, so Grbic is obviously no flourishing.   I believe they need to price their entrees $3-4 lower to bring more people in.   For great food from this part of the world, we'll stick with Arber, which has become one of our favorites.",2013-08-21 20:20:09

We were heading home after an extended weekend in PA.  We stopped in Columbus, OH for lunch and somehow nobody felt the need for a pit-stop before we made it to the restaurant for dinner.  Not quite sure how that happened but it makes a good story.

Late dinner on a Tuesday night.  It took a little while for someone to be designated as our server and the guy who sat us felt bad about the delay so he comped us an order of their corn fritter things as an appetizer.  Those were some really hot (temperature) little bundles of fried goodness.  Slightly sweet, crunchy and gooey all at the same time.

I decided on their shrimp po boy for my dinner.  I was anxious to see how it stacked up to the version I had tried at Gulf Shores the previous week.  I would like to say different but both were good...but that would be an understatement.  The shrimp on this version smoked the ones on the version from Gulf Shores but the remolade at the other place was a lot better.  Maybe its a tie - maybe not.

Kid 1 claimed she wasn't hungry but then decided on an order of fries.  They were pretty tasty and both looked and tasted as though they had been cut freshly in house.  Normally I would not let her call that dinner but after being cooped up in the car with the kids for almost 12 hours I really didn't care.  There goes my nomination for father of the year.   

Kid 2 ordered a humungous burger.  I thought about trying a bite but just didn't have room.  The wife nicked a corner and reported that it was very good.

The wife went after their SBR - sausage, beans & rice.  I managed a bite as well and it was delicious.  The sausage pieces were pretty small but that just meant that every bite had a piece or two and the flavors were uniform throughout the dish.  The beans were in a slightly spicy sauce.  Not spicy like hot, spicy like flavorful.  Delicious!

The kids each had a piece of their snicker's cake for dessert.  There was an invocation of the daddy tax and I thought it was a pretty good dessert choice although it is doubtful that it was house made.

Great place!  Can't wait to get back to dive a bit deeper into their menu...",2014-08-11 02:25:50

We came here for our anniversary and the wife let them know it was a special occasion in advance.  It was nice that they welcomed us with a couple of glasses of champagne.  Our waitress was very attentive and took great care of us during our visit...she's the reason for the 4th star.

The food?  Not that special.  Well executed but not exceptional.  The deviled eggs we started with were just alright.  I appreciate a twist on an item but it has to be discernible beyond the visible to add anything to the dish.  Several things listed as ingredients (trout roe, fried capers, cayenne) sounded like they would fit that bill but they were of such small portions that they got lost among the other flavors.  

No bread service :(

Next up for me was their chicken schnitzel.  Well-executed fried chicken but adding a couple of lemon slices on the side doesn't really make it a schnitzel.  Also, they have spaetzle elsewhere on the menu but offered a warm potato salad and a small salad with vinaigrette as the sides for this dish instead.  Those two intermingled on the plate and created a different flavor profile than perhaps the chef intended.  This dish needs some work as it really came across as fried chicken with potato salad and a salad - not what I think they were shooting for based on the menu description.  

I tried a bite or two of the wife's steak - great flavor but overcooked and very chewy.  We asked about the cut and it was something we had never heard of before.  Lingering impression of that dish is that it took a lot of work to masticate.  To paraphrase something I picked up along the way...the juice wasn't worth the squeeze.

Without a doubt, the high point of the meal was dessert.  I didn't know you could make bread pudding out of pretzels...wow!  Add in some chocolate and some ice cream and it was absolutely the right way to end the meal on a high note.  If the service wasn't already enough to bump this review to 4 stars the dessert would have carried the day.",2017-08-05 14:17:58

It pains me to go with 2-stars on this review given how excited I was for them to open and to get to try their food but I just cannot get to ""A-OK"" based on the experience or the food.

We visited with another couple and a 5th wheel who wasn't a 3rd wheel at all.  We ordered a variety of stuff.  Nobody was really impressed.  We left and went somewhere else to have dinner all over again.  It was much more enjoyable.

Here are my observations by menu item:

Mandu - I've had a lot of mandu all over the peninsula and look for it on this side of the pond.  I'm not sure what I was served but it wasn't mandu.  The ratio of wrapper to filling was way off.  Maybe calling this a fried dough knot is more appropriate?  Also, if we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time...how was it possible to serve us luke-warm deep-fried anything?

Korean Fried Chicken sandwich - a significant miss as well.  Not as spicy as expected.  Served with lettuce and tomato instead of something more inspired.  At least it was served at a proper temperature.

Overall notes:

Kimchi - how in the world do you name your restaurant after an ingredient and not push that ingredient forward?  How is it that every entree doesn't at least come with a small (1-2 oz) cup of the stuff?  Big miss.

Portion sizes - it's a pain in the ass to get to this place.  Good luck finding parking that doesn't cost a bunch and then they serve tiny portions at high prices?  I cannot see where this is a sustainable business model.

I love the notion of this place but the execution comes across as half-baked.",2019-03-15 21:41:58

One thing that I really enjoyed about this lunch was the 1/2 chicken parmesan sandwich.  I often avoid OG because I just don't want to be THAT full.  Sure I could eat less - but seriously, not with those bread sticks!  The 1/2 sandwich, salad and two bread sticks worked out exactly right and I didn't feel compelled to take an afternoon nap at a customer's site.

A little red pepper tapenade up on ya... I'm telling you, it was so good. Nicely charred, juicy, flavorful seitan.... I couldn't shut up about it to my husband when he came home later that night. It was wrong of me. It really could come off like bragging. 

 I told him that if that if seitan of that caliber was made from an animal, I would hunt, kill and eat that animal everyday. It was supposed to be a high compliment, but certainly is just yet another insane thing to say.

Every single taste was delicious. The eggplant and cauliflower braciole was delectable covered in herby salsa verde, the wood-roasted maitake mushroom dish was amazingly rich and creamy, without cream...how do you do it? Smoky mushroomy goodness! More cauliflower is more better so some crispy cauliflower and pickled ramps were in order as well. Delicious. Everything. Delicious. Cheesecake? Delicious!

I gotta say the decor is somewhat dated and vintage, but it was packed with hungry dinners. 
Between all of us we had breakfast foods, sandwiches,  salads and full meals. It was great to see this array of offerings at 1 table and be able to discuss our individual meals with each other.
My first concern was when it took over a half hour to get a glass of water. My second concern came after all the orders were taken, which took 45 minutes and we still had not recieved our basket of breads. The bread finally showed up about 10 minutes before our meals started arriving.
Okay I understand it was about 12 people, but that should not be overwhelming for a restaurant that has been around at least 20 years, or any restaurant for that matter.
The next concern is when the food started arriving and the first 2 plates were sent back as the server or kitchen did not make the food as it was ordered. I am not exact on how many orders were wrong at the table, but that was 2 I heard the orders placed and the customer not even take the plate as the mistakes were so obvious.  Another in the group had a food allergy to onions, I heard her ask if her order could be made with no onions, no problem replied the server. When it arrived it was covered in diced green onions, come on really?  Did she really need to specify white, yellow, purple, green onions and shallots? Thankfully she noticed it right away and no paramedics were necessary.  This is all just gross negligence on the restraunts part. Either the server did not relay the orders correctly, the kitchen decided to cook without reading the tickets, the kitchen expadater was non existent or asleep and obviously the server did not check her orders when she pivked them up in the kitchen.
Okay LOL, my order and food was half delicious.  I ordered the chorizo, mushroom and red pepper omlet.  The omlet was a bit dry, but had great flavors. It was served with this thick red pepper or something like that piled way too high and heavy on the omlet, it was overwhelming, so I removed it all and the omlet was quite flavorful. The home fries were over seasoned with their Italian herbs, but they forgot the first ingredients,
 the salt and pepper. The home fries were cooked, but not properly. They should have had a harder outside than the inside. When I was almost at the end of my meal, I finally got the servers attention and asked if a roll was supposed to come with my meal, she said yes, but I didn't want it, I explained that was a mistake and she wanted to know what kind of roll I wanted. 
What is the problem with this picture? They have multiple roll choices and I am supposed to know what they are? She started naming some off and I took the honey one that sounded healthy. It arrived cold, my omlet was eaten and the home fries were going to remain on my plate. The roll looked promising, as I tried a nibble, if it had been warm, I think it would have been the winner of my meal.
I am just glad it was a fairly priced meal and it is sad to think the roll may have been the star of the show, if it had been given a chance to shine.
One last concern, it was regrettable that the server had several people show their driver's license to prove it was their debit/credit card she was returning to them, when she only had 3 checks in her hand.

They are an institution. My grandfather died at 100 and his favorite restaurant was Red Lobster, for that reason alone and all the memories it gets the fourth star.
No really I like Red Lobster, when I am in the mood. It is not a high class seafood restaurant, it is a chain that probably pays cooks off the street $10.00 per hour. Personally I think some of their prices are outrageous, especially the ""FRESH"" seafood. I really like their bar and it would be a good drinking bar, but they have like nothing for happy hour. The bar is big and comfortable and just inviting. I find the restaurant usually to be loud and have an obnoxious atmosphere, so just eat in the bar.
I stopped by a few weeks ago after the gym, for a quick and healthy bite and ate at the bar. Damn those warm cheddar Bay Biscuits!! I told myself that just 1 would be okay, since I had just had a good work out, well that didn't happen, more on that latter. I ordered the grilled Tilapia with a house salad, broccoli and a plain baked potato (with sour cream on the side).
The Tilapia was well seasoned, very thin and a bit over cooked... hey it's very hard to not overcook fish that thin. I have always liked their baked potatoes, they have almost a creamy texture to them, really unusual for a baking potato, but good in a different sort of way. The house salad is iceberg blend with some shaved carrot pieces 1 tomato wedge and croutons. They said they had no light dressings so I did the oil and vinegar with some lemon wedges to zip up the flavor a bit. Salad was not particularly fresh, but it was really cold. And the broccoli was just plain,under  seasoned and lifeless, but it wasn't overcooked and mushy.
OK you are right it only deserves 3 stars, I have to leave sentiment out of this. Okay now that I changed that, back to the biscuits,  I swear, no I know they are addictive, There were 2 in the basket and after the 1 I allowed myself to eat, they were both gone and since I was sitting at the bar and the bartender was bored 2 more hot biscuits magically appeared and disappeared. I usually find service in the dining room disappointing and slow. 
If any of you know me, seldom do I eat out like I am on a diet, I eat for the experience and to try new things and really taste the food quality. Clearly this was a utilitarian quick dinner to just feed the stomach. Service at the bar was excellent and the place always looks clean.
For the price it was a healthy, decent meal. For dining, no I never would call Red Lobster a restaurant where one dines. Quick meals and keep the biscuits coming nights it is just fine.

I was taking a friend for an early Birthday celebration. It was so hot out, when we were seated, we just wanted to chill & have some ice water. Craig was our server & totally related & gave us time to cool down, no hurry.
First Craig took our drink order & brought us nice hot bread for the olive oil & spices
 The bread was great & had wonderful texture &  flavor. The herbs in the olive oil were bland & had no pizzazz, this was disappointing. 
I started with the escargot, can't pass them up when I see them. They were server in an escargot serving dish with clarified butter, herbs & garlic that was not overpowering. The snails were succulent & well seasoned, swerved with hard toasted baguette around the plate. The escargot butter was a great dipping sauce.
Unfortainately we both wanted prime rib, so no sharing tonight! The salads were fresh & crisp & hit all the right notes. My partner got the large prime rib & I the regular
 A waiter brought the entrees to the table & looking at them, I was disappointed. Before he could serve them Creaig showed up & said this was not our order. He immediately went to the kitchen & returned with 2 beautiful prime rib dinners.
We both agreed the prime rib was the best we had eaten in years. Tender, well seasoned & cooked to perfection. The twice baked potato lacked anything to set it apart, it actually was one of the worst I ever had. It lacked the major components that usually make a twice baked potato: bacon, green onion or chive, sour cream & cheddar cheese. The only redeeming quality was the didn't over whip it & you still had some of the "" meat"" part of the potato.
This was a Birthday dinner & they did give us a piece of frozen German chocolate cake. You could easily tell it had come in frozen & lacked moisture & any great flavor, but it was a nice gesture. I made reservations & put down it was a Birthday celebration & requested no embarrassing singing.

There was too much sauce and way too few toppings on the pizza.  The bread sticks were not doughy enough for my taste, more like flat bread and lacked flavor.  The had more rosemary than garlic, and I favor garlic butter.

Nah.), but when my best friend made a trip from Texas to Philly to visit me, and she requested clam chowder, I researched the best place. Oyster House came up several times, so we decided to give this joint a try. I'm so happy we did! 

The website lists a lunch menu served from 11-2:30 and a dinner menu from 5pm onwards. As we were due to arrive in the window between 2:30 and 5, I called to ensure we'd be able to grab a bowl of the ""made fresh daily"" clam chowder. The hostess cleared up any confusion we had - they do serve food within that window, but the menu is more limited. The kitchen is closed from 4:30-5 pm but the bar is still open. 

This place is very trendy, clean, with a very downtown vibe. I felt slightly underdressed in my lacy shorts and tshirt. We were immediately greeted and sat at the bar by the lovely bartender. Very handsome and very attentive. We ordered two bowls of clam chowder ($8/piece), an order of fries to share, and my friend ordered the Mexican Firing Squad to drink. The food was ordered and delivered in less than ten minutes. The Mexican Firing Squad was made with jalapeno infused tequila - it was a strong drink, worth the $11. However, it was VERY spicy. Almost undrinkable. Definitely meant to be sipped with a big glass of water closeby. I love spicy foods, but if I had ordered that drink, I'm not sure I would have been able to finish it. Once some of the ice melted, it was a little more tolerable, but if you're someone with any aversion to spice, DO NOT order this!

The chowder was delicious! I'll be honest, I'm not generally huge fan of seafood. I'll try anything once, so I ordered the chowder (never had clam chowder before!) I was worried it would be fishy. It was anything but - it was creamy, hot, delicious, with chunks of bacon and fresh garnishes. I had no qualms about polishing the entire bowl, and did so in about 6 minutes. The fries were okay. They were served with a spicy mustardy dipping sauce. They were garnished with something green, parsely or something. Not a huge fan.

Happy Hour is M-F 5-7, and Saturday 9-11. I am definitely keen to come try some of their specials, and maybe I'll even gain the guts to try oysters. Their drink menu is very impressive, so I'll be back for that alone.",2017-07-14 19:53:20

Third- umm...YUM!! The donuts are so creative and Ssoooo good. I had a jelly donut and my friend ordered the tiramisu. Both were awesome. My friend's tasted exactly like the dessert. It was awesome. 

We also ordered coffee drinks. I got a delicious vanilla latte. It took a little bit of time for the drink to be made, but it was actually nice to enjoy my donut in the restaurant.

I do find that the food is simple yet delicious. Everything is plated nicely and overall the service is beautiful. My issue with Wilko's is the consistency and the price. It's way too expensive for what it is and there have been a few times where I had some overtoasted buns or bread for either their sandwiches or burgers.

Sandwiches and burgers are worth it for lunch despite the $12-$16 because they come with fries. I would switch out the herb fries for truffle or cotija fries. They often change up the menu every few months to keep things interesting. I love the texture of the fries and the flavors work well together. The lemon aioli is sometimes a great dip depending on the day. Grilled cheese is one of my favorites, but if you aren't too hungry splitting a pizza with someone is great. The sauce is warm and flavorful and the dough is fluffy and not greasy.

The dinners can go from $15-$40 but are delicious. I had the house fish once and the curry seasoning was divine. Overall I find dinner to be a treat.

Brunch is my least favorite meal at Wilko's because they don't offer more than other places but charge just as much if not more. Eggs and potatoes shouldn't cost as much as they do. In addition it's not satisfying, with a restaurant that offers so much I think that they are pretty good but pricey.",2016-04-14 04:39:10

For example, I didn't taste any mango flavor in the Mango Madness - there was a sweetness to the sauce, but that's it. Given all the various toppings and ingredients, I just expected more robust flavor - the most flavor was in the jalapeño hamachi. The tuna was shockingly pink...I've never seen tuna such a hot pink color. It weirded me out a bit, in all honesty. I'd consider going back and trying some of the more basic rolls just to see if the fish is tasty on its own, but we just weren't overly impressed by the specialty rolls we tried. On another note, our server was excellent. Quite attentive and knew the menu well. Our bill for 2 with the above items, no drinks or dessert, was just under $70 including tax and tip.

My mother in law ordered the braised short ribs, not bad, but not great. The flatbread that boasted bacon, heirloom tomatoes, etc on it was really good. I ordered the bone marrow where there was absolutely no flavor. Yes it was gelatinous, but it was in dire need of salt. No salt nor pepper at the table. A very pompous move on the chef's part.

When we asked about food, the bartender mentioned that some of the latino guys working in the kitchen had been sharing their recipe for handmade tortillas and my friend, being a fan of authentic Mexican cuisine jumped on the Boar soft tacos, served with a pepper sauce.

I had the Seafood Springroll [picture above]...a crispy treat that was your standard GBD on the outside, but had a steamy soft inside owing to the the way the shrimp & I'm guessing crabmeat liquid had mingled into the roll as it fried.  Served with a sweet/spicy peanutty dip and a more tangy fruity chop or compote, the two oversized springrolls made for a great midday snack.

It took us forever to get our food (well over an hour) and there were numerous tables left dirty (I counted 8 at one point) while patrons were waiting for a table. The poor employee that was working the front of the house seating patrons was also acting as bus boy and at one point I saw him run a delivery out--it was craziness! 
Now on to the food. We ordered the tots with beer cheese and were left underwhelmed. The tots needed more seasoning and the beer cheese didn't give them what they needed. I asked for salt (salt and pepper were not on the tables) and ketchup and it made a huge difference. Our next part is what earned The Goat a 3 star review instead of 1 or 2--the food was delicious! My husband got the ranch hand burger and I got the double pepperoni pizza. Both were excellent! The food is good enough that I would be more than willing to give The Goat a second chance even after our lackluster initial experience.",2020-01-02 01:25:12

Quick trick to help with the wait time, know at least what drinks you want. They are delicious. I suggest the mule's paradise for those mezcal and tequila lovers. Order the drink with the choice of water so when they return for dinner selection, you can order a second round!

I would def return and probably see what next season has to offer. Looks like they change menu with what's available at the farms and it makes sense. Excellent time.

Old review: 
This is one of our favorite go-to restaurants and our favorite overall Italian. 
Let me tell you why.
The food. Ah-mazing!
The pizza. We love everything about their pizzas. The homemade crust, the sauce, the homemade sausage. It is thin crispy perfectly seasoned and cooked dough. Do yourself a favor and eat the pizza in. It's best right out of the oven. My husba says great cold too.
The apps. Love the calamari and fried eggplant. Crispy and again perfectly seasoned and cooked. 
The entrees. Husband loves the chicken Parmesan although I like my breading a tad more brown that they serve it but they're happy to accommodate you if you ask.
The salads. Fresh and the Caesar dressing is legit. Not premade. Legit Caesar. 
The desserts. Love the cannoli. I have to confess, I like my own Italian cream cake better because mine is a light fluffy cake and Gendusas is dense. The gelato is delish too. 
The portions. We once served 4 people with a chicken parm order which comes with a side salad and a pizza. We had leftovers. It's soooo much good food.
The vibe. The atmosphere feels homey. The tables are old distressed and repurposed  doors with glass tops. Frank Sinatra, The Godfather  and a lot of other Italians line the walls. The pizzas are named after mob bosses and you get a souvenir cup with a famous line from the movie, ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" 
They have a wall unit ac which will sometimes freeze you to death and it's loud.
They don't serve alcohol but you can bring your own wine and they'll pop the cork and bring you wine glasses. No corking fee.
The service is good and friendly but not over attentive. They aim to please and they stay busy as this is a popular local joint in Kenner's Rivertown neighborhood. It's convenient for us.",2020-02-28 01:06:13

I walked into the bar area, and instantly realized that this wasn't what i was looking for, so i went around the corner, and found a coffee-tea house and placed an order for a pear and brie sandwich, then went to sit outside.  The cashier brought me my sandwich, but wouldn't take a tip really... yet he came back to clear my plate.  Kind of a strange service set-up, but everyone else seemed to understand it, so maybe I need some work?

Anyway, the sandwich was AMAZING!  Genuius pairing.  I feel lucky to eat something so delicious for lunch.  One of the perks of being an 'adult'.  The pear was poached and carmelized and sweet, and the cheese was gooey.  It was atop a toasted crispy bread that had received a quick smear of butter to 'grilled cheese' the sandwich.

Street Corn: (2/5) It was not absolutely terrible so I can't leave it at 1/5 but it was close. You can clearly tell the corn was canned or frozen and mildly warmed in a microwave if at all. It had a little flavor from the toppings and hot sauce I added but not much. Certainly not worth the $4 

Pork Belly Taco: (2/5) Again, it was edible and not terrible so a 2/5 is pretty accurate. The pork belly was very dry, over cooked, and room temperature. It was clearly sitting out for a good while without any heating element. The sauce and pork fat made it slightly good but very overcooked pork at room temperature just made for a terrible time eating it.

The restaurant is really cute and spacious with a lot of nice decor; there's murals both outside and inside that are Instagram worthy. It's a great date night spot for couples or groups. I went here on a double date and we ordered the chips and salsa with cracklins to start off with, duck confit empanadas, beer battered fish tacos, Al's southern bone-in fried chicken fajitas and enchiladas (I think).

Overall, our group enjoyed the ambiance, food and drinks. The fried chicken on the fajita entree was delicious but it was obvious that it was Popeyes (it is Al Copeland Jr's restaurant after all) that came served in a frying pan with an $18.95 price tag.

The first visit, I had Pollo all cacciatora which was just perfect. LOML had Scampi e Faggioli and gave it a hefty thumbs up. 
We both had dessert - he had Creme Brulee (of course) and loved it so much, he had it the second visit and proclaimed it the best he's ever had. And seriously, it's about all he ever orders for dessert, so he has many different Creme Brulee to compare it to. 
I had Italian Rum cake the first time (soooo good and moist) and the second time I had a special of the night dessert, which I can't remember what it was called, but it was fabulous (see the picture). 
The second visit, we split the gnocci al pomodoro - little pillows of potato goodness. I wished I'd ordered a whole dish to myself so I could take some home...

About an hour after arriving, we finally got seated. Our server got to us pretty quickly and took our drink orders.

Actually, 3 of the 4 of us went with the French toast, and supplemented with different sides. The half order of the French Toast is actually pretty sizable - that, with a huge Turkey sausage patty and scrambled eggs, made for a very nice brunch. I did succumb to peer pressure and ordered dessert - maybe it wasn't succumbing as much as encouraging everyone else, but semantics - in any case, with our servers recommendation, I had the Eggnog Cheesecake; another friend had the Pear Almond Caramel Bread Pudding, my other friend had the timeless Creme Brulee and my last friend opted for a Matcha Latte drink. Needless to say, we were all satisfied. Pricing is pretty good - if you don't go for any dessert, and you don't have any alcoholic drinks,  you can probably keep your bill under $20, which isn't bad at all for Saturday brunch.

We had a gift card so we went pretty big. It was also a date night after many weeks/months, etc of not having one.

Our waiter offered to prepare (mix) it for us and I recommend that if you order it, you ask them to do it as well. The duck liver mousse was a favorite as well. I loved the jam that was paired with it. My mussels were nice and light after the heavy appetizers, but I have to say I really enjoyed my partner's fried chicken. If you like fried chicken this is a must order. The mashed potatoes are so creamy and pair perfectly with it. The dessert was a cherry on top of a wonderful meal.

Fifth and Taylor is also good for large groups so there were quite a few there. Many of them out of towners, possibly bachelorette parties.",2019-02-25 22:27:12

I'll start here, I've had Chicago style pizza a few times in SF one being at Little Star which is a city favorite. I have never been to Chicago so I can't say I've ever had the real thing. Part of the reason I've only had it a few times is because it's just not my thing. It's too heavy. Plus, I'm a die-hard NYC style pizza fan.

So earlier in the day I went to Bella Nashville and consumed their meat pizza with an egg. It's by far one of my favorite pizzas in Nashville. I did this not knowing that after my top dog's game we were going to 312 to watch the World Cup and eat more pizza. My friend said it best though, ""it's not pizza, it's a pizza casserole."" Amen!

We ordered two deep dish pizzas, wings, and numerous drinks. The place wasn't packed but there was a good crowd. Our waiter forgot three of the drinks and to put the wing order in. He apologized profusely and comped the wings. He did everything he was supposed to so I'm not totally faulting him but you know, it was a hiccup. The pizza was good, my manbot says great, and the wings were just fine as well. I had a vanilla donkey (I think that was the name) to drink and it was fantastic. We also tried the weird shot that Chicagoans adore? and I will say, ""no, never, it just sat in my throat and I will never drink it again."" I don't regret trying it though. I love regional drinks.

Overall all this is what Germantown has been missing for quite some time. It's a place where you can come drink, or you can come eat. It's family friendly and sports friendly. The TV's are huge and viewable from anywhere. The room is clean, open, and well-lit. This also causes it to be loud. So be prepared. Overall, kudos to the space. I liked it a lot!

I'll definitely be back, probably to try the arancini and mozzarella sticks. I hear they are HUGE! I'll also be back because I like the environment. If you are a Chicago pizza eater, then you must try it. If you're not, then there are other items you can choose from even numerous salads that don't seem too heavy.",2014-07-14 17:04:12

It came with breakfast potatoes and two eggs, which we got over medium; your average fillers to make the plate look better. I also ordered a side of greens. I loved the teensy kick of spice to it.

We were seated at a really cool, long table underneath a pergola. The whole restaurant is lit with white Christmas lights and it's very pretty in general. I ordered a glass of Chianti which was only $6.25, not bad at all! We had to wait at the bar for a little while before we were seated, but it wasn't too long of a wait (20 mins maybe). I ordered the bruschetta to split with friends and the linguini with clams. The bruschetta came with three slices which was perfect for the three of us who shared it. A few different variations of bread were also brought to the table with butter. The linguini with clams that I ordered came in a red sauce (even though the menu said it was in a white wine sauce) with a few jumbo shrimp thrown into the mix. The clams, shrimp, and pasta were pretty good, but I wasn't too crazy about the ""clam meatballs"" they added. They just has a funny taste to me. My boyfriend ordered the seafood special which came with a lobster tail and many other forms of seafood over a bed of linguini in a white wine & garlic  sauce, which I liked a little better than mine. He thought some of the fish was a little undercooked as well. Luckily, the portion of his meal was huge so he was able to push the sketchy parts of it to the side.

In general, this restaurant has been good to me.  The beer selection is reasonable, with options ranging from light to porters.  I tend to enjoy the Betty Burger, which is laden with bacon, fried egg, and avocado.  This location is absolutely packed on Fridays and Saturdays so I'd suggest reservations.  You can always attempt to get a seat at the bar with varying levels of success.  Upstairs is a second bar and additional seating and several flatscreen TVs playing the most popular sport channel at the time.  I've never found the service (hostesses) to be particularly welcoming or really make the attempt to help seat people but they aren't generally rude.

On to the awful experience.  Random Wednesday night, sitting in the downstairs bar area, I and a friend order the Betty Burger medium rare (as with every previous visit).  The burger comes out looking fabulous, yet when we bite into the burger, the center is virtually uncooked - think of what ground beef looks like before you even put it on the grill.  I understand medium rare to be warm, slightly cooked, and still pink.  This seemed to have been the same understanding from the kitchen until this last visit.  Needless, we asked that it be cooked a little more and met little resistance.  We were informed they'd have to completely remake the burger because of all of the toppings, etc.  We thanked them and waited for the burgers to come out - exactly the same.  At this point, I was disappointed but rather hungry and figured I'd risk it.  My friend was still perturbed with this 'medium rare' and reasonably requested that it be cooked longer.  At this point, our waiter began to debate 'medium rare' and informed us, 'this is how our chef does medium rare.'  Given all of our previous experiences, this seemed unreasonable but we simply said that the center was still entirely uncooked and thus not medium rare.  The waiter took the plate back and they remade it again.  We noticed several of the kitchen staff poking their heads out to stare at us, which just seemed unprofessional.  On the third attempt, the burger at least seemed somewhat cooked in the center and was consumed.  When the bill arrived, we were charged for both burgers with no apology and perhaps a little sass.  While I recognize it's a business of making money and it's not a requirement to comp food for mistakes, we spent an extra 45 minutes in this restaurant waiting for the kitchen to make a burger correctly.  Along with the disappointing service, this experience has soured my otherwise pleasant feelings.

Prices aren't cheap enough here to be this disappointed at any point.  Despite the convenience, I'm not sure I should  come back.  Cheers.",2013-04-03 19:48:10

The concept:  Amazing!  I do love Brazilian steak houses.  I love their salad bar and all the wonderful choices of top quality items.  With such a wide variety of meats that are all you can eat along with a great salad bar and hot food area, Tucano's really sets themselves apart from the rest of the places in town.

Ambiance:  From the moment you hit the parking lot and walk in, a fun and colorful decor capture your attention.  You are immediately greeted by the hostess as you walk in as they take you to your table.  A great atmosphere awaits you.

Once you are seated, you are immediately greeted by a kind Waiter/Waitress for drink orders and after that, you are open to hit the salad bar or begin your meat feast.  This all sounds great, why the 3 stars?  I have been here several times and it lacks consistency.  I do have to admit, my wife and I like our meat well done and when you go on busy nights, most of the meat that comes out on the busy nights, the meat is luke warm and it is hard to get meat well done.  We have been strategically going during slow times just to ensure that our meat comes out hot and well done but you can't always do that.  Sometimes we come on a Friday or Saturday night to celebrate someone's birthday and we just recently did that.  After telling the meat servers that the food continued to come out cold, they said they would try to bring out hot meat and it continued to come out cold.  Please don't get me wrong, I have had some GREAT meals here but they seem to fall short and inconsistent on busy nights. I would love to give them more stars but when you are paying a good amount of money per person for their buffet, you have to be able to serve hot food with consistency.

Most of the crawfish were charcoal colored and they were extremely salty.  One of the bites of food that I took was so salty that I had to dispose of it.  I wouldn't recommend ordering this dish from here to anyone.

My bf ordered the Alligator Bites, and they were lukewarm, hard, and had an old taste to them.  It was evident that this alligator was not fried at the time we were there.  I assume it was probably fried earlier that morning.

I would never come here again.  The food wasn't good and definitely wasn't worth the price.

To make matters worse, I had a hair wrapped into my silverware napkin that was waiting for me once I started opening the napkin.  Just shoot me!",2014-11-12 15:20:51

Shame on Omni for passing this off as one of their properties. This is pathetically below their standards. The staff is helpless as they abide by management's policies. Really?

Here's what we got for $270/night (or thereabouts).......
Flimsy mattress even after asking for another or at least a bed board. We were both sore from the experience.
Window shutters that were broken.
Dirty coffee mugs.
No microwave.
No mini refrigerator.
1 regular tea bag for a 3 night stay...... and it's against their policy to refresh the tea bags and water bottles.
Filthy shower with mold/mildew even after notifying the front desk.
Torn screen on the sliding door.
Our room was by the pool pump and it literally droned all night. You'd think they could add a little sound insulation as they freely admit to this being a problem.
The stairs from the parking lot are in disrepair and some of the lights are out, so walking is treacherous at night. And they charge for parking!!!

I just stayed at a Hampton Inn for a third the cost. I had a comfortable mattress, spotless bathroom/shower, microwave, refrigerator, free breakfast and free parking.

1) Really good breakfasts any morning you don't feel like cooking.
2) Really awesome breakfasts any time after midnight.

However, I have their entire breakfast menu memorized and committed to heart.  Any Denny's you go to is going to have the same stuff.  There is really no difference between Denny's, nothing to make one stand out over the other in terms of food.   However, some have better cooks than others and some are definitely cleaner than others.  This Denny's is one of the clean ones.  

What always surprises me is when people rate a Denny's on Yelp, they act like they are tragically disappointed, like they were expecting to eat at the Four Seasons with white glove service and a Michelin rated chef.  It's DENNY'S, for heck's sake.  And, to take pot shots at what people are wearing, how their hair and make up looks and making fun of their profession...it's just tacky and classless.

If the corn tortillas were homemade then I will stand on my head, spin in circles while twirling plates on my feet. So disappointed and those babies cost me a small fortune! Nearly $30.00.

Cons: The place is small. There are very few places to sit, so no matter when you get there, you are probably going to have to wait. But there isn't actually anywhere for people to wait, so you just sort of gather in one of the corners and try to entertain yourself.

The place is also very sparsely decorated. I can understand going for a minimalist style but this place just feels a little bit empty.

The waitstaff is very friendly but when I went he was still struggling with English, so there was some difficulty with asking about menu items and ordering. It's not bad enough to be frustrating, but just be aware that you should be patient and as clear as possible.

Pros: Like I said, the wait staff is very friendly. Even though there were very few tables and plenty of people waiting to be seated, I didn't feel any sort of rush once I was able to sit down. They were happy to serve us as long as we wanted. Which is good because it was not a particularly fast service.

The daily tea was delicious when I went, and I think it's a great addition to the meal.

The ramen, of course, is what it's all about and I would give it a 4/5. The broth is delicious and one of the best I've had. Be aware though, when the menu says that the soup will come with pork, it means there will be a single slice of (very tasty) pork. If you want more, you should definitely order the extra pork to get (according to the menu, I can't verify this) an extra 3 slices. The egg is also tasty, but if you were hoping for soft boiled or at all runny yolk, look elsewhere.

Unfortunately I can't vouch for or critique any of the other menu items, as my party only ordered two bowls of soup, but if the rest of the food lives up to the ramen, I can't wait to try them out.",2015-10-08 18:47:39

Beyond great food, the coffee is AWESOME. It's fresh, and better yet, bottomless! The only bad thing about the place is the long wait, but you can't really blame them for that. In the warmer months, when you can sit outside, they're able to seat more people and keep the waiting line moving.

My girlfriend and I are admitted pizzaholics. We decided to try this place last night after reading some reviews here.

Scrolling through the menu and I came across this gem... 'Mozzarella Cheese Stick Pizza,' say WHAT? We had to try it! We were here thinking we'd just get some mozzarella sticks laid on top of a cheese pizza. That would've been cool and all but what we got instead far exceeded our expectations. It was covered with tons of delicious, springy, real mozzarella, topped with marinara, parsley, and basil. I love simple and cheesy pizzas, and this one hit the bullseye. Even the crust was awesome -- A nice thinness to it but it's still substantial, foldable, and chewy.

Definitely give this spot a try. I'm only giving the place 4 out of 5 stars because we've only ordered from then once. We'll be ordering again, though, that's for sure. I foresee tons of other tasty pizzas and sandwiches in our future.",2016-08-18 18:10:24

When a dinner opportunity came up, my wife and I randomly chose it for an evening meal last week.

Let me start by saying there was nothing wrong with our meal, or our evening out.  I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant, and the great atmosphere it provides.  It's hidden back away from the street, and with comfortable indoor seating and nice patio seating, it's just a really nice spot.  The service was good, and the prices reasonable.  The food was OK.  I ordered their salmon fish-and-chips, even though I was thinking that seems like a weird thing to cook.  But hey, we aren't at the ""Cod Grill & Brewery"", we are at the ""Sockeye Grill & Brewery"", and I always like to get a place's signature item whenever possible.  Well guess what...  Fried Salmon prepared with fish & chips is a bit odd.  It was fine, but I think I like something more traditional cod or halibut for fish & chips.  The chips were very ordinary, but I still enjoyed them smothered in malt vinegar like my ancestors in the old country like it. My wife ordered the Reuben sandwich, which is one of her standard favorites.  When she got it, she said is was ...ok..., but a bit bland.  She mentioned a couple of times that it was ""dry"".  I offered the dill sauce that came with my fish and chips (with me preferring the cocktail sauce anyway), and when she added that to the sandwich she said, ""Yes, this is pretty good."" (Sorry, forgot to get pictures). 

Now obviously the place is a micro-brew pub, but we are more into pub-food than the brew, and all I can say is that this place is just ok in the food department.  Certainly not bad, but not really good enough to be a dinner destination for me in the future.  I'm sure the place is fun to go to for big games or sporting events, or to have a few beers with friends, since the atmosphere and setup of the place seems great for that.

Keg & Kitchen is within walking distance of our house and so we went last weekend. We sat at the very fun communal table (but had it all to ourselves) and had good service. Our waitress was a gal named Ryan and she knew exactly when to offer refills of our beers!

There's an excellent beer selection (great mix of local beers and imports) and the prices are great. You will definitely find something you like there.

I enjoyed my grilled cheese and my pretzel, but my husband found his fries with Welsh Rarebit sauce not so hot. There are a bunch of different things on the menu that I'm interested in trying (rare for a vegetarian to find!) so I'm looking forward to going back. I really wasn't sure what the menu would be like because it's not posted on their website (as of now) so the variety of vegetarian options was a pleasant surprise.

The beer was good (Peroni!) and the service friendly and patient, and surprisingly quick considering they make pizzas to order. The wait wasn't long at all, even though we got there during peak time on a Saturday evening- even if we had had to wait, I wouldn't have minded- the open kitchen was a lot of fun to watch.

Bathrooms were ridiculously nice, but the floors were slippery. I'm not sure why that was- maybe because it's so new? Just be careful.

My mom ordered the lobster and shrimp quesadillas that barely had any seafood in it and had the overwhelming taste of onions. I tried to play it safe with the jerk chicken But couldn't believe it did not have any flavor. It's jerk chicken! And the salsa on the side tasted like it came out of a jar and was sickly sweet.

They have a significant assortment of Chinese food, some American things like French fries and tator tots, fresh fruit, desserts like almond cookies and little pieces of layered cakes and ice cream, and sushi.  They'll have protein like chicken, and you can get pineapple chicken, mandarin chicken, chicken and broccoli, peanut butter chicken .... there's probably more, but like I said - an assortment of items and an assortment within the categories of food.

Only a couple of things that bother me - that don't stop me from returning - is that the tables don't seem to get clean.  I have watched them wash the tables down after people leave and it doesn't appear to get a good washing.  And then when I have sat down at a table it has a stickiness to it.  Sometimes I wonder if there is a cleaning agent in the towel they are using or is it just water?

The other thing is that they have signs that say kids under 10 must be accompanied by an adult to the buffet.  And I have never seen it enforced and almost always see little kids there making a mess ... or taking something and putting it back!  Yikes.

It's a good value though because they have shrimp and crab and it's all you can eat.  I paid $23 for lunch for my son and I and that included sodas (not included in the price, and you do get free refills).",2020-03-22 19:15:51

This is because they had a batch of precooked noodles that they then mixed with a watery sauce. The taste was completely off. Then, there was their Chicken Satay. Satay is supposed to be grilled, skewered meat. Their version was basically pieces of breaded and fried chicken on skewers. Though the food is edible, it is not Thai food.

There are also a couple of other things to mention that may annoy some people. This place is only open air seating and as result there is no air conditioning.

As for the band, they were fun and the dance floor was big enough for everyone to shake their ass.  Sound was good I think - at that point the booze was taking over and it seemed fun to me.  Let's be honest, it all seemed fun to me.

They also have TVs and some people I know go there on Sundays to watch football and do their Sunday funday up right.  I think they also have some food to help you not have tooooo much fun.

Jed's place isn't in the most obvious location.  Right off of West End behind the Electronics Express.  I don't think Jed gets as many ladies to visit him as he might like because it is hard to see that he's there.  Poor Jed.

When you walk up you notice that Jed's place has a nice front patio.  Go in and find a nice sized room with TVs and tables.  Up the stairs to the left find more tables and seating around a raised bar and even more TVs.  Up more stairs you will find a huge patio, currently enclosed for the cold weather, with enough space to host the UT Alumni party.  Not bad Jed!

So I sat with my friends and excitedly perused the menu while drinking economically priced happy hour draft Miller Lite.  They have burgers, pizzas, wings, sides, other sandwiches, etc.  I also really liked the option that you could get menu items made smaller if asked - good for when you are trying to stop gorging yourself with huge menu portions.  They had any bar food you would like, plus, PLUS mac'n'cheese as a side option.  Don't mind if I dooooooo.

So I got the Boss burger that comes with a fried over easy egg on top.  Ah, reminds me of that time I was in Amsterdam and they brought me a burger with a fried egg.  I'd never seen such a thing and was intrigued...and excited...and, ultimately, pleased.  Plus I had the munchies something fierce.  I digress.  So this burger was a pleasing large size and the first bite makes the yolk run out pleasantly all over your hands and the plate below.  Nom!  However, I really wish the burger had been a bit more juicy and flavorful...and that they had asked me how I wanted it cooked.  Medium to medium rare thanks.  Anyway, still not bad.  The fries were not as crispy as I like them but had a nice seasoning on them.  At the risk of seeming gluttonous, I also ordered a side of mac'n'cheese because I believe I've found the holy grail of mac and cheese dishes (sadly in Dallas) and I'm always willing to give a place a chance to oust them.  This didn't but it did have a nice bread crumb topping and wasn't your standard cheese mix.  Not awesome but not bad.  A-OK perhaps?

The service.  Man.  The chick we had was pleasant and she managed to get everything right even though we had a ton of people there.  However, it seems perhaps they understaff because at times you are parched for your next beer or waiting to order food or waiting for your tab and your waitress is nowhere to be found.  I think perhaps more staff would help?  Not sure.

Overall, not bad.  They have trivia on Thursdays and apparently karaoke on Fridays.  I do love karaoke at random bars y'all so perhaps I'll give it a try.  Otherwise I will keep Jed in mind when Sam is boring me....but shhh don't tell Sam!",2012-02-11 01:35:16

That's an extra $6.00; this week you can get six large organic avocados at Bristle Farm for that price. To make it  bite even worse upon  arriving home and eating our wraps it was very difficult to find any avocado. Finally found some, but it was pathetic to say the least (see picture).

The fries were cooked a little longer than other places, just enough to hold a crisp edge for a good 5 or so minutes.

well done - you'd be hot stuff.
As it is now, your fries are crispier than Gabby's..
Not as crispy as Five Guys.

Your burgers are cooked to order, which Gabby's does not, Dino's does not, and all the other places that will only cook to Medium - sighting the Gov't guidelines.
The buns are buttered and grilled...  5 stars - right there.
Burger is cooked to order..  but not overly juicy like an 85% lean burger would yield.

Once downstairs I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with the space. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Just a hodgepodge of tables and chairs, some random booth seats and a bar. No decor, nothing that gave you the specialness of being in a private space. Me and my party pal felt like we had just been shoved into someone's basement. 

Also I was so damn hot I couldn't stay down there. Unlike upstairs where the parameters are all open windows, the basement was cave like.

I ordered the sizzling plate and my friend ordered the hot pot and our plan was to share them both. My sizzling plate came out in a reasonable time so we started eating that. It was exactly what I expected and really aesthetically pleasing and delicious. 

We realized that about 15 minutes had passed and there was no sign of the hot pot. At this point we already finished the sizzling plate. Our plan was to share and eat them together, but it would have been really awkward if we weren't planning on sharing and I had finished my meal before hers came out.

None of the servers had checked on us during that time and we had to flag one down (the table button didn't seem to do anything) to ask for a status update on the hot pot. The server didn't say anything to us like ""let me check"" and just went straight to the back to ask someone. The hot pot arrived about 10 minutes later. We had to remind the servers to bring us water half way through the meal and then flag then down to fill them up again. We also had to ask for the sauces.

I thought the flavor was good (again, without anything to compare it to) and enjoyed it once it finally did come out.

It wasn't until we were home that we saw a Yelp photo of the menu and my friend realized that we were totally scammed on the hot pot. The ingredients that were supposed to come with it were not inside and instead it was meat, fungus, lotus root, and mainly cabbage. This was really disappointing to find out after the fact.

It was a busy night and there seemed to be a lot of servers. They were certainly hustling around and showing a sense of urgency but seemingly with no direction. Maybe there was no manager that night? I'm not sure how there could be that many people working and passing by our table but NO ONE noticed our empty water glasses or thought to check on why one of us had food and the other was sitting there for 15 min without any food in front of her.

I'm pretty disappointed in my experience here aside from the sizzling plate and would probably rather try somewhere else for hot pot.

The food was decent, and this place would have some serious potential if management could get their employees to 1. actually prioritize customer service and 2. put the correct ingredients in the bowl.

My wife and I scooted down on opening day to see just what they had to offer.  We went in about 10:45 so had to order off the breakfast menu (served until 11:30).  My wife ordered the Liege Benedict and I ordered the traditional Benedict.  Both were excellent.  Instead of a poached egg, they were served over easy insuring a good runny yolk to mix with the hollandaise.  However I would have to say that my wife's was the stand out between the two.  It was served on a special waffle and had regular bacon instead of the ""standard"" Canadian Bacon.  This is what I would consider a ""signature item"", something that will make you consider this place over others.  Mine was quality. I personally would have liked a smaller more standard english muffin, but the ham eggs and hollandaise were perfect.
  The potatoes were temptingly tasty causing me to have a bit or two extra when I shouldn't have.
  We intentionally lingered for about 10 minutes over our Hub sourced coffee so we could get a shot at the soups, Gino the Soup man soups if you are already familiar with them.   Today was Coconut, Corn and Sweet Potato Chowder and the ""every day"" Tomato soup selection.  If you can't decide you can get a sampler for $6 for both soups!  Both were very good.  The CCSPC was very unique and the tomato wasn't a bisque style which was a nice change from what normally see.  I did add in some of the ""fire oil"" that was on the table.  Great addition to the tomato soup.  Really made it pop but not overwhelm the dish.
  The atmosphere is light and open.  Not your normal Midtown feel, but a refreshing change.  Lots of Ambient light.  Lot's of four seater tables and two seater tables.  Just two booths and even a few bar height tables too.  
  We enjoyed the coffee, and they were nice enough to bring some soy creamer for my wife, but don't know if this is a regular thing, so don't hold them to this nicety.

The rest of the menu was full of important words like local, organic, vegan, gluten free, raw and even paleo!  And from what I saw, this is no ""vegetarian snob shop"" but a real restaurant approach to good food and reasonable prices.  

The only negative that I perceived was the late start time for lunch.  My wife disagrees with me that 11:30 is too late to start serving lunch, but I think 11:00 might be a better time to be ready to serve the lunch menu.

The service was great, especially considering this was the first real day of business.  They may have had some soft openings I didn't know about, but for a first real day, I was very impressed.  Many of the places around town could learn how to open a business from Great Full Gardens.

A few additional notes.
Coke products...but also some Oogave soda products as well.  Gonna have to try these next time.
Gluten Free isn't just lip service here...they understand the allergy side of gluten free.
Kids menu is available too.",2013-03-18 20:22:56

Boom!!  Head splodes!!

Yep.  This was a mind blowing meal.  We walked in for a late lunch early dinner after Moo Dang made our dinner choice for us by not being open on Mondays.  They had a happy hour special on of 30% off apps and drinks.  We ordered everything off the small plates menu, plus the Shao Kao Meatballs and the Momma Lin's Fried Taiwanese Bacon.  It was all great!

My favorite was the fried pork filet.  Just perfectly cooked and spiced.  Loved the Guay-Ah Pork.  This place SEEMS authentic, but what would I know about authentic.  Authentic or not...this place IS really good so far.  The service we had was very attentive, but that was because we came between lunch and dinner.  So if you want very good personal service, go for a dunch!

The place really hasn't changed much since it's Sushi bar days.  But why change something that looked so nice anyway?

I did mention that I didn't really think the name equals the food.  But one of the staff explained to me that the name was a word play and they were trying to avoid all of the standard Asian cliches.  They succeeded there!  But really after having the meal I had, they could call the place poo poo platter palace for all I care.  The food was excellent as was the service.",2015-07-02 04:40:43

Love and mercy pizza was also meh. Unmemorable. Soggy center. 
14 1/2 was good. I liked the spicy soppresetto. Best pizza out of the three, but NOT great pizza by any means.
Chicken and waffles is a total rip off. The chicken is okay. The waffle is dry and bland. It's a big plate of mediocre $20 chicken and waffles. Not worth it.
The eggs in purgatory was fine. They completely overlooked it the first time so we had to send it back.
The crostanza was probably the best thing. It was a nice little fig, ricotta pizza.

The pickled veggies are awesome.
Salt and vinegar chicken wings were unique and surprisingly great. Peanut wing's were just okay.
When the entrees were set down, I asked if we could cancel the fries and the waiter unapologetically said the fries were ready. We asked for two order of fries when we first sat down, along with all the other appetizers. While they said the fries were coming, they didn't come until the entrees and all the entrees had fries.

Chargrilled oysters (different from Deanie's on the previous night, but just as delicious!)
3 dozen raw oysters
New Orleans medley (jamabalaya, gumbo, andouille sausage and rice & beans, portion is for 1)
Crawfish etouffee (DEEEEELISH!!!)
Boo fries (french fries with gravy and cheese)  TIP:  Get the gravy on the side so that it doesn't make your fries soggy!!

I have to say, the food here is simply out of this world.  The ONLY complaint I have is with regards to the seating.  We were right smack in the middle and the table was so small we barely had any room to move around.

Acme has a very sports bar feel to it... so don't expect any sort of ""ambiance"" but DO expect good food at a reasonable price!!!

They have a 15 dozen oyster challenge -- if you can complete it within X amount of time, your name goes on the board.  More than that, you get to go on the Wall of Fame category.

Our bill came out to be 120 after drinks, tax and tip.

There are lines at all hours of the day, and they don't take reservations.  By the time we left, there was a line about 30+ people long.  So just go a bit earlier than you'd like to eat and you'll be set.

Despite that the chicken and biscuits was amazing, the drinks were good and strong and I didn't yelp, determined to give it another shot when they could redeem themselves.

I did this for Saturday brunch. We were literally two of six people there. Despite that, service was still slow and unengaged. Example: my friend ordered tea. It took 10 minutes. When he server brought it, he poured it, already steeped. Which explains why it took that long. He did not, however, leave the teapot (tea was $4 for one small cup) or bring sugar or cream. Nor did he offer any. Nor did he come back.

Considering we were one of three tables, our food took a really long time. But we kind of expected that at this point. What I did get, though, a pasta with kielbasa dish, was plentiful and delicious, as well as reasonably-priced.

We ended up sitting at a table near the trash can so my son could eat his macaron. 
-The plate the macaron was served on was wet, and the water dissolved almost half of the macaron (b/c its kind of spongey). Luckily, my son is 5 and so if I pretended it was SO COOL that the water was eating his cookie, he thought it was, but in truth I was a little disappointed that it was served to us that way. 

I've heard that there is a Hoi TEA Toi TEA in the Fashion Mall, which was great to know, as I really enjoyed the tea latte but not so much the setting it was served in. I'll be back for a lavendar fog latte -- to go. :)",2019-05-21 15:17:42

I was happy to see that it isn't strictly vegetarian.  I saw chicken, goat, fish...

The one drawback was that the rice dishes has large chunks of cinnamon sticks in it.  I bit into a cardamon pod and it was very unpleasant.  I am new to Indian cuisine and maybe this is customary, but some people who don't chew their food well may choke on this.",2012-01-15 10:08:08

It was fine, sure, but nothing spectacular. They did have an acceptable selection of NA beers, which won them some extra points from me. Our server was attentive but tried to upsell us three different times... I get that that's part of the job, but at some point it was a little too much and a little too insincere.

I phoned Fork a day or so prior with the final head count for our reservations.  We had 15 confirm.  I made the reservations for 7:45pm, 15 minutes earlier than the expected arrive time of our crew (as I like to get there a bit early and make sure everything is prepared and ready to go).  I also phoned the day of the event to confirm and warn that our group would be needing separate checks.  I arrived at 7:45pm and unfortunately, they were not ready for us.  I was assured that the party that was currently occupying our space would be just another 5 or 10 minutes.  45 minutes later we were finally seated.  We ended up with a party of 17--so that meant 17 people lingering on their stairway for 30 minutes (the extra 2 people were not the issue as our table accommodated 15 and we squeezed the last 2 in).  There also was a few snafus with our checks (a drink I hadn't ordered made it's way to mine--and then after getting that removed, a drink I HAD ordered wound up on another yelper's check...oy).   

So, clearly, handling reservations and a large party in general, on a busy Friday night, is not their forte.

What they did right:

After we'd been waiting a while, they mixed cosmos for each of us and brought them to us on the stairs.  When we were finally seated, they brought us several platters of appetizers to enjoy on the house.  All the appetizers were quite good (one to note was the asparagus fries--yum!).  The cosmo itself wasn't a winner (our party gave Fork's Cosmo 2 stars of 5--personally, I gave it 3 stars of 5--but I had a sip of several others and their mixing was very inconsistent--some had lots of vodka, some too much lime, others tasted like mostly cranberry--weird but we've run into this issue at a few places, when ordering 15 cosmos at once, it seems to cause difficulty in dimensions).  

However, Fork has a great lineup of specialty cocktails to choose from.  I thoroughly enjoy their 3 in the Chamber and their A Thyme for Bourbon--both well mixed and well presented.  I also enjoyed a piece of their butter cake, which is haaaauuuuge.  My people, share it.  Firstly, because it is so ample that it is PLENTY for two people.  Secondly, because, it is butter drenched, sugar laden, and  ice cream topped--do you REALLY want to enter into the eye of this caloric sh*t storm alone?  No.  Of course not.  You must bring others down with you.

I loved Fork before this visit and I'm sure I'll love them again.  But, standing on the stairs with 16 people as we waited...and waited...and waited, I definitely wasn't feeling the love. 

Bottom line:  Maybe not the best place to bring an overly large party.  And, skip their cosmos, but don't fret, they'll have another cocktail you'll enjoy.  Of that, I'm certain.",2014-04-12 16:27:11

It was close to lunchtime and there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant (either inside or outside). It took a while for anyone to greet us, but once we got a server, he was extremely nice and good at attending to our table. The kitchen was very slow in getting the food prepared. Also since it was after Breakfast stopped being served, they only had two breakfast items available with the lunch menu. 

We ordered a Walnut apple salad with shrimp, chicken wings, and 2 egg sandwiches (One with potatoes and one with a side of fruit). Both the salad and the chicken wings were good, but the egg sandwiches were just OK.

It ended up being 11 of us, so we grabbed a chair to add to the end of the table and opened up the extension ourselves. The service was the less than expected (although It wasn't very busy).

I haven't been here in over a year, so I was excited to try something new. I ended up ordering the seafood platter grilled. It was just OK, nothing spectacular (especially for $28). I also ordered the gumbo soup. Amazing spicy flavor with lots of seafood!

We went in on a Friday night and we're told it would be an hour wait for a table for 4, to our pleasant surprise, it only took about 35 minutes to get a table.
We started with Hurricanes which is how we start every visit to NOLA. Although it wasnt quite Pat O' Briens, it was probably the best hurricane I have had in Tampa. We then ordered appetizers. We devoured a generous portion of ""Maws fries"" which is French fries covered in roast beef and debris. For anyone who has never been to the deli called Mother's in NOLA, debris is the gravy a drippings left in the pan from cooking roast beef. They were soooo good and I would come back to tibbys just for Maws fries. We also ordered boudin balls, which I was slightly disappointed in. They were made up of mostly rice but they did have good flavor so we still ate them all.
After eating those fries I wanted more debris, so my husband and I split a ""12 napkin sandwich"" which is a roast beef and debris sandwich. We ordered it plan so there wouldn't be any pesky lettuce and tomatoes keeping me from the full flavor of the debris.  Again, I didn't look up until it was gone. I was very full at this point but I had already ordered a cup of sausage jambalaya, so I had to try it. The sausage was perfectly spiced and there was a generous amount of sausage mixed in the rice which gave it some kick. Again, very good. 
The service is still slightly slow but being we were there the first week they opened, we understood that they were still getting used to things.

We had a table to 8 for my partners birthday. I ordered two bottles of wine for the table. Yet for some reason our server took what seemed like forever to bring out the wine glasses and even longer to get them poured. Meanwhile drinks people had ordered from the bar were also backed up someplace. No water had hit the table either. 

Once the beverage comfortableness passed several people ordered appetizers. I tried the Escargot and while I could understand how it was well received by others at the table it didn't wow me in any way. 

I had the Smoked Tomato Bisque. It paled in comparison to very similar soup anyone can get at the fast casual chain La Madeleine (they also sell it canned at Sams Club) It was virtually flavorless and one of the girls at the table simply didn't choose to have hers after tasting it. 

I also tried what I can only describe as cold mashed potato soup. It too lacked and was passed around for people to try. Nobody wanted it. 

The birthday girl had the Arugula Salad. It was good, but again no wow factor. 

I had several more selections from the Prix Fixe menu. I believe there was a crepe. I opted for the 4th course of a Creme Brulee however it was not brought out at the end of the meal. 

Everything I ordered lacked flavor. Most everything needed salt. 

We were there on Saturday June 25th at 7pm Not long enough ago for me to have forgotten something great. 

Someone had brought a bottle of White Port Wine to share with everyone after dinner. It was nice that they were able to accommodate us with this. However more than half the bottle was full on the table when we left. We came back after one drink downstairs and nobody could account for where it had gone.

As I was focused on the birthday girl and her experience I didn't review the bill when it arrived. I have no idea if I was billed for the Creme Brulee I have no idea if there was a cork fee.",2016-07-05 17:07:02

The food IS good! The plates are bigger than the average buffet plates. They also offer things that you don't get at your everyday chinese buffet. They have sushi, & you actually see the chefs rolling it. There is a chocolate fountain that you can dip wafers, marshmallows, fruit, whatever you want into.

Still, we had just left The Pub, Doc B's does not open for another six weeks, our girl Lindsey was not working at Bar Louie and I would not be caught dead in Blue Martini...so we figured one drink at Taps would not kill us.

Our service was excellent from a polite young man named Parvez and my friend's cosmo was ""kickass."" The interior seems odd to me, and the bar has very limited seating.

First, this just might be the best frequent customer/rewards program available for people who dine out on a regular basis. 

Many casual restaurants have these programs and they simply are not worth the constant emails and carrying the card around with the name of the business.

Duffy's version of such a program is excellent. 

In less than six months, I've accumulated well over $100 in rewards through either regular visits, promotions or even the company throwing an extra perk or two on my account for something they felt they could or should have done better.

While I wish the bar was bigger (But that's the previous tenant Macaroni Grill's fault), Lexie and Samantha are always who we want to see behind it whenever we visit. They hustle, they're friendly and they remember regular customers. And while I'm not a fan of men working the bar at a place like this, Desmond is rock solid back there as well.

Nazzi, Guy and the managers are always visibly making sure things are going the right way or if any customer has an issue.

Not sure yet if there are plans for a second Duffy's in the Tampa Bay Area, but I certainly enjoy earning and using all my rewards at this location.",2016-10-10 10:30:20

Do not have a reason. Just kind of forget that it is there since it is completely isolated from the other food options at International and not something you notice when driving Boy Scout Blvd in either direction.

I initially entered my online order here via Yelp, but decided to check something else before finalizing it and making payment. 

Sure enough, if I simply went online via the CPK website and ordered there, my order would cost me less money...so keep that in mind.

My order included a flatbread, entree and side and it was waiting for me at the designated time to pick it up. The employee who handled my order was a wonderfully nice woman who made sure I had everything I paid for and all the other things that usually come with takeout.

The flatbread was A-OK as they say here on Yelp to indicate a three star experience. I've had better, but it got the job done.

My piadina was memorable and ordering the full size version gave me enough for a second meal a couple days later. As a short rib apologist, my eyes are often drawn to this menu item and my appetite was not disappointed at all.

The baked potato soup also got the job done and I appreciate Nueske brand bacon being featured on menu items as well.

While I agree with others that CPK is priced a touch high for a casual dining experience, the variety of items is also more creative than other casual spots offering pizza, pasta and more.",2018-05-22 21:20:31

However, I am a fan of salads sometimes instead of a sandwich and thought I would try their Cuban in salad form.

The new location is quite nice and an upgrade from the previous tiny spot next to Smoothie King. 

It was a late Saturday afternoon and there was only one employee working at all. I give him credit for getting everything done, as he knew what he was doing and did not have any help. He said it had been slow all afternoon, but I was one of about four people who came in at roughly the same time.

My wait was a bit too long, despite his efforts. If I had known it would take that long, I would not have stopped in the first place and would have gone to Lenny's right down the street. 

The finished product was good. Plenty of meat, cheese and other ingredients and very filling for one person. A salad this size needs more than one packet of salad dressing, as this is a common mistake made by many places...except PDQ which always gives you two or three.

Oh, I also added an order of stuffed potato balls. You receive four for $2.49, but they are rather small. Not something I would order again, because it just was not worth it.

The coupon did not list an expiration date, and this is a franchise, it was good at the Swan location only.

I would have dismissed the idea, but I didn't want to disappoint my nephew.  I hung up the call and went to the website hoping my coupon would work there.  Nope.  It said to enter my zip code and it would list the locations closest to me.  Their website was problematic ... it jumps to delivery, and I wanted to save $3 and pick it up ... it was hard to figure out how to change that ... also, I'd selected a $12 special for an XL with 2 toppings.  That was confusing how to get the normal charges removed to save an additional $4.  It had selected the location for me, so I wasn't paying close attention - I ended up with the franchise on 22nd.

After a brief discussion he pointed down the block to another establishment, Wong Wong, he suggested I should try.  I figured, why not, he lives here so he should know the good spots. Wrong!  Wong Wong must be his brother's place because my experience there was worse than my first choice.  I had to wait five minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. Finally someone looked at me and pointed to one of the empty tables where I was to sit. After that table was cleaned I did sit and perused the extensive menu. Actually there were two of them, the regular one and another for the lunch specials. I decided on #5 from the regular menu, noodle soup with soy chicken. Big mistake. While the broth had decent flavor and there was an abundance of okay noodles, the chicken was more bone than meat. I had to actually search through the soup to find something to chew on. I was hungry so I did finish the soup, but it didn't get any better. When the bill (written in Chinese) came it was higher than I expected so I questioned my server about it. She took it away somewhere and came back and explained, ""she made mistake"" and provided a corrected check.

Huge menu that can cater to anyone's taste. I got the chicken breast platter and it came with pita bread, grilled chicken strips, traditional sauce, feta, tomato and lettuce, potato, rice pilaf, green beans, and a Greek salad. What a deal. I didn't like that the chicken strips were very long and my pita slices were too small, so I had trouble cutting the chicken and fitting all the toppings. It was a bit of a hassle so I started to eat the ingredients separately and I was making a mess. I wish I would had gotten it in a wrap so it was already together. Also with all that on one plate (salad comes first though) the juice from the tomato was seeping under the pita making it soggy and I didn't notice. Wish it was diced tomatoes so I could have easily put in on the pita bread instead of having to cut a big slice of tomato. I was a fan of the potatoes, but I didn't care for the green beans.
As for the whole experience, I could tell that the waitresses didn't seem excited to be there. The service was alright but the waitresses weren't very friendly and happy. Even when someone ordered a flaming cheese appetizer they would say opaaaaaaa with no excitement. The dining area looks really nice especially with the murals of Greece architecture but the chairs seem to be old as the material is ripping and pealing. It was also quite noisy in there.

The seating for this place makes it seem very authentic. It's small, close knit, and quaint which really gives it that homey authentic Italian feel. The menu also reflects that, along with the ever vastly large rotating house specials. Between that and the regular menu, I could not make up my mind to decide what I wanted to eat. But that was no problem since there was no rush or pressure from the staff to. I believe the waiter came back three times because I was being so indecisive. Not once did I feel pressured or pushed into making a decision. In addition to their patience the staff here is wonderfully friendly. I got a visit from practically the whole staff! 

I began with the caprese salad which was wonderfully fresh, with the most creamy mozzarella. They then recommended I choose the lobster ravioli, my date choose the seafood pasta. While the ravioli was tasty and filing, unfortunately there wasn't a lot of lobster within the ravioli filing. No bueno, which is typically while I steer clear of ordering seafood at most restaurants. I should've known! My dates seafood pasta featured plenty of seafood-so at least they delivered there. For dessert we shared the tiramisu and had two cappuccinos. No complaints there! Soft, airy, and mildly sweet.

""I can't figure out why the reviews on Grubhhub and Yelp aren't better!? Ordered from them for the first time...

- order of several items was correct (seems there is generally at least one thing wrong when you order delivery!)
- delivery person was friendly
- food arrived quicker than expected
- lots of condiments and extras with the order, to make sure we weren't short on anything (huge stack of saran-wrapped nice napkins, silverware, yummy bread knots that apparently came with the meal, plenty of butter for them, and finally - a place that gives you enough salad dressing for the whole salad!) 
- they also have a huge menu with some unique items that cannot be found at similar style restaurants (bacon wrapped meatloaf stuffed with prosciutto, sun dried tomato risotto balls stuffed with mozzarella).""

Review from today...

- Confirmed 3 times that the vegetables would be on the side and packaged separately from the meatloaf. Despite that, they still came mixed in with the meatloaf. I am a vegetarian and was going to have the vegetables as part of my meal, but couldn't because they were mixed in with the other meal. Very disappointing after confirming multiple times on the phone when placing the order. 
- no silverware
- no napkins
- no little rolls (instead just a piece of bread)
- no butter to go with the bread

Turtle soup for appetizer
Shrimp & grits for my main course
Bread pudding souffle for dessert

I also got to try all of my friend's dishes which were the shrimp & lobster fritatta, pecan encrusted fish and steak & potato.  

We started with the garlic toast and my turtle soup came out shortly after.  My soup was rich in flavor but a little too salty for my preference.  The shrimp & grits was a rather light dish.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly and paired great with the grits.  I think next time I'll order the steak & potato as my dish because I think I would've been more satisfied with that dish.  

The bread pudding was a great ending to our lovely meal.  I also tried my friend's banana split.  You can't go wrong with either dessert.

We were seated in a pretty reasonable time frame, our waiter took our drink orders, brought our drinks and told us about the specials.  We asked for some more time to look at the menu and then everything went downhill.  I have no idea what happened to our first waiter, but all of a sudden there was a new waiter in the area.  A couple more tables were seated after us and they received their drinks but we still hadn't been asked for our food order (our menus were closed and we kept trying to make eye contact with the waiter.)  Then all of the tables that had been seated after us had been asked for their food order and we were still sitting there waiting....  We finally just got up and left without paying for our drinks.

Well, I ended up going back with my family.  My brother talked me into it since one of his friends is a waiter.

Between the four of us we got: Duck Ragout, Chicken Piccata, Seafood Pasta, and Cioppino.  All were great, except the seafood pasta could have used a little bit more flavor in the white sauce.

Why go to Harp & Crown? Obvious reasons: 
- It's Michael Schulson's (Duh!)
- Gorgeous interior.
- Underground bowling alley. (Yes, exactly!)
- Accommodate big parties.
- Delicious food: Try the pizza with unusual ingredients (Smoked octopus. Anyone?) Also, try the Skirt Steak and the roasted olives- you'll love them.

And after few (many?) brews, we finally decided to get some food in our bellies. Kathleen suggested going to Treno, and since she always rave about how good their pizzas are, we agreed.
I had the Kennett Square pizza. A wood-fired, mushroom pizza, loaded with bechamel, cheese, and few kinds of herb sautéed mushroom: Crimini, oyster mushroom, and shitake. Rich and delicious. 
Another good reason to head over Treno, is the Italian Budino. Smooth, creamy and rich chocolate mouse, paired with salted caramel and accented by cookie crumb. Oh, it was heavenly.

Great pizza spot, but personally I wouldn't cross the bridge regularly to get my pizza fix, just because we have tons of pizzerias in Philly. However, If I ever again in Jersey, I'll definitely eat here again.

I have two questions for you: 
1) Would you like some delicious breakfast-or brunch-or lunch?

2) Do you want to know what to eat for breakfast, like a king?


If you answered yes to either question, then don't miss Fitzwater Cafe.  A BYOB cafe that serves breakfast and lunch. 
Can't go on weekday? Try going for a weekend brunch. I went on a Sunday with my friend, Rena, and we had a fantastic experience. Our friendly server Nicole, brought us some water and complimentary cappuccino ( only during Octobor'15).Then I had the Wild Mushrooms Omelette with caramelized onion, spinach and feta cheese. It was delicious and very flavorful. Also, we both shared some thick-cut creme brûlée French toast, and I could not be more pleased.

""All happiness depends on a leisurely breakfast."" So, are you in?
Sincerely, 

Your Philadelphia Yelp member,
Sari A

Crazy how living here my entire life, I never went here before. Finally, for our 7 year anniversary, we decided to give it a shot! I was always hyped for this place when I tell her about it. It was during Jazz Fest, so parking was a bit annoying with some walk, but nothing too bad.

Walking into Palace Cafe, I can already feel like I was going to like it. Inside is nice, well decorated, and the staff very courteous. I told the hostess it was my first time and she told us we were gonna get the best seats in the house. She seated us by the window so that we could get a whole view of canal. Great seats, that's a plus! 

My girlfriend and I ordered the Cafe Eggs Benedict and the Grillades and Grits with the Banana Foster for desert. My Grillades and Grits were not bad at all, but definitely not memorable. The Eggs Benedict was the real problem. It came out cold, a bit under warm. I asked my server if he could get us a new one because it was cold. He took the plate and a new one literally came out in 3 minutes.. kind of fast huh? We tasted and tried to see if it was hot, it was only lukewarm. We decided not to bother them again because we felt it wouldn't change. All in all, the entrees were a bit disappointing. 

We were hoping the saving factor for this review was the banana foster. The way the server made it for us tableside was nice. He explained a bit about it and served it to us shortly. The banana foster was nice and all, but nothing crazy to say that it was ""original here"" or ""Our famous"", because it was honestly still a bit forgettable. Oh and I must mention.. even though it tasted okay, the presentation SUCKED. Just look at my photos, it looks like a hot soupy mess. Yeaaah.. very off putting.

Regardless of our first experience, we felt it could be better and would be better in the future. Maybe it was a bad day, but I'll eventually give this place another shot. Overall disappointed, but the atmosphere, service, and the making of the tableside banana foster saved it from being 1 stars.",2018-04-28 17:29:31

I gave it 2 stars before and I'm gonna stick with it again for this review. I've tasted a lot of ramen, and this ramen is not that bad, but certainly nothing memorable. Better than Little Tokyo, but nothing like Kin. My previous review, the ""too spicy"" Ramen was WAY TOO spicy. Living in New Orleans, I've eaten my fair share of spicy foods and my tolerance is pretty good. This time, I decided to stick with the regular ramen and asked for spice on the side. After adding my own appropriate amount, the ramen was much more enjoyable the first time, however, the servers weren't too attentive to us. After receiving the check, I noticed they charged me extra for the spice on the side. That doesn't make sense at all because the ""too spicy"" ramen is the same price as the regular ramen. That kind of threw me off which attributed to the same 2 Star rating. Again, nothing that would bring me back here, especially since the ramen is nearly $14.",2018-02-28 16:06:57

I did also try a bit of the buffalo wrap and it was very tasty. I definitely recommend getting the buffalo wrap over the pulled seitan. 

In general, if you are a vegan or are interested in trying VEGAN dishes, Three Carrots is a place you must try.

Although we made our reservation months ahead, we were seated at a mediocre table with an excellent view of the kitchen. (See photo.) The place was slow, yet we were not given any of the nicer available tables. We should have seen the writing on the wall and left, but we really wanted to eat there. A mistake...the food was sub-par, even the highly anticipated chile relleno was a sloppy mess.

A Friday night during Lent (Good Friday) seemed to be the best time to check out a seafood establishment.  It's cozy, in two small dining rooms of tables and booths with a bar.  It was not packed but full.  It looks like they upgraded it with new fixtures from the former pub (19th Hole, I think) and it seemed clean.  

The menu is laid out in a placemat which kind of has a down-the-shore feel and the murals on the wall are bright, nautical and cheery. Our waitress was attentive and gave great service.  There was gentleman that checked on our service, as well, prior to food delivery.  (Owner?)  The menu was straightforward and didn't really give descriptions of the dishes.  The prices were reasonable for seafood  'delivered fresh daily' as noted on the menu.

I ordered snow crab legs but the specials did sound delicious - crab ravioli in a blush sauce with sun-dried tomatoes, etc.  But I was fixated on Snow Crab - kind of a Lenten tradition on a Friday with me and the boyfriend.  He ordered the same thing but his was a trio with mussels and shrimp.

The food came out quickly but to my demise, it was in a pool of salted butter.  I immediately thought I was at Red Lobster (if that is your thing).  Of course, I did not exactly specify steamed with butter on the side, but what a mess!  Slippery and crab don't mix so it took forever to eat.  I don't really eat that much salt  frequently but I felt a lot bloated and smelled like a garlic butter that no wet-nap or hand soap could penetrate effectively.  The crabs themselves seemed fresh and large but were tainted by that presentation. 

My boyfriend's dish was similar - the shrimp and mussels were tough and the corn-on-the-cob was mush, likely due to the butter content. 

I am sure since this place is new, they have some kinks to work out with regard to the menu, etc.   There is always room for improvement and I look forward to hearing more positive reviews so that I am tempted to revisit.   It certainly is cheaper than Red Lobster but the dishes and prices are not unique enough to set it apart.",2014-04-23 21:37:34

I like this second location much better than the original in center city because there are a lot more tables to dine in at.  Also, parking is pretty easy to find and in some cases free.  

I really enjoy the buffalo ""chicken"" nuggets with sweet potato fries.  The texture to me is better than actual chicken in my opinion, and the buffalo sauce has a nice little kick to it.  My favorite part is the black bean cilantro sauce that comes with the fries.  It's creamy and super flavorful.  If you love cilantro, it's a must!

The bistro bella sandwich is another item I see myself ordering again soon.  The marinated mushroom is topped with salty olive spread along with artichokes and onions.  It's fresh and not heavy at all.

My only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep.  If you get a sandwich, fries and a drink, you'll easily be around $15 a person pre-tax, which is a lot for fast food.  However, when I'm craving this type of food, it's a price I'm willing to pay.  I would visit more often though if the prices got knocked down a bit.

It arrived quicker than I would have thought in less than ten minutes, but since the place wasn't crowded, I figured that was why. 

My food was only slightly warmer than room temperature. The fries tasted good and fresh cut although they weren't piping hot. The seafood made me sad. The shrimp was rubbery and overcooked, the scallops had a nice texture, but they were a little undercooked and had some raw batter inside, and the worst was the oysters. They were so gritty and rubbery, they weren't even edible. The batter was so flavorless too. For a place that is named after its oysters, gritty, tough oysters were the most puzzling and disappointing part. After tax and tip, I spent over $22 on seafood that I mostly couldn't eat. I wanted to say something because it was so bad, but after the sever brought the food, it was next to impossible to track him down.

The fish was breaded and crispy on the outside and flaky inside, but I think it could have used some more spices in the breading.  The toast it was on was rather plain.

I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning here and can no longer bring myself to go back. I loved the idea of having a diner so close to home but the food was just never good anytime we went. It just always seemed like shortcuts were taken everywhere no matter if it was, breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Once there was water leaking from the ceiling onto our table.

It's a shame because the folks that seem to run the place always seemed so nice. I would always see them go out of their way to talk to their regulars and see how they are doing. This is the only reason for the extra star. 

I'd have to say that this was the worst food I've had in Pennsburg hands down on multiple occasions and for that reason I cannot give it another chance or recommend to anyone.",2016-07-03 11:25:18

Yes, it's Americanized and hipster, but that's okay as long as the concept is done well, and it is here.

I had the spicy crispy chicken and veggie tacos and both were solid.

Good chips and guacamole.  Good margaritas (many with interesting and fresh twists).

Dinner started off with the charcuterie plate. I can't say I enjoyed it that much. I loved the pecans but that's about it. It just wasn't my cuts of meat and cheese. I don't know if it's a seasonal thing or its always the same items.

My friend and I shared an entree and ordered about three apps/sides to share. We had way to much food and no appetite. Maybe we were too busy catching up?

Entree was pork ? See, I didn't really care for it so I don't remember anything about it. 

I remember the crab gratin. That was delicious. We had the fried green tomato, I liked that as well. Lastly, was the gritcake. Which I could have passed on. 

The menu looked very promising and for the most part I enjoyed the meal. I didn't have anything epic. But I just think it was due to my choice of dishes. 

We had two cocktails and the bill totaled to around 70-80$.

Pros: The cocktails were well-mixed the day we went. Try the Mexican Mule - which comes with jalapeno infused Altos tequila. It's a pretty awesome kick! The decor is cool. Service is a little shaky, but nobody has ever been an outright jerk... if you can call that a ""plus"". 

Cons: Everything else...

Full disclosure, I have tried this place more than once and each time tried something different on the menu. Nothing is authentic, at all - well, as authentic as Mexican Food in America can be.

The most awful of offenses was that I ordered tacos and they put COLESLAW from a tub on them. (It tasted identical to the stuff you get in the tubs at Schnucks for a backyard barbecue). You don't put REGULAR cole slaw in a taco...??? When you go to a legit Mexican restaurant where they serve good tacos and they say ""slaw"" - they DO NOT MEAN the creamy cole slaw that you eat as a side at picnics - that is not what goes in Mexican tacos! Disgusting.

The fish and shrimp were both ""fried"" and it was painstakingly obvious that they were pulled from a frozen bag and tasted, also,  very much like something I would give to the kids on the weekend when I am feeling like a lazy Mom... You will have a VERY hard time finding any tacos that are grilled, as opposed to fried, unless you just get the Tacos Pastor... Other than that... Gross. I had to SOAK them in Cholula just to eat them and at one point I was letting the slaw drop out of the taco because I would have rather just have had frozen convenience food shrimp and fish and bare taco than any of that... 

Who made this menu? Who was responsible for these tacos? Who EVER thought that these were acceptable?  Perhaps, they need to talk to the Tilford family who own Mission Taco ---- or Fuzzy's Taco Shop..... or Vallesana on Cherokee???? Somebody has to help them...

Who decided that Mexican restaurants charge you for the salsa bar? 

The most validating thing about my adverse feelings was when I returned to SLU and spoke to various people about my experience they all threw their hands up and said ""Oh no we do NOT eat there! That place is gross - how has it taken you so long to figure that out...""

As an elite Yelper, I try to give places multiple changes to disappoint me... three times and you got this review.

What I got instead was an overpriced meal that was very clearly meant for the tourist crowd.  I'll agree with reviewer Eileen Z that this place is a lot of hype and doesn't quite deliver at the end of the day.

I'll start with the good: the food is very good.  I got the gumbo and the blackened drum and both were delicious; perfectly cooked and very savory.  The dinner portions were also big, so even though you're paying a lot, at least you're getting a lot of food on the plate.  The breads in the breadbasket (aside from the molasses muffins) were also very good.  They give you four types and they're all very savory.

What I didn't like, and what killed it for me, was the service and the atmosphere.  I found the service to be too draggy in the parts where it should have been quick, and too quick in the parts where it should have been paced.  It took forever for us to finally place our orders.  When we did place them, our food came out very quick.  Then when it came time to pay, it took forever to get the check and get our cards back.  Additionally, our server was not satisfactory.  He not only spilled water all over the table and nearly all over my boyfriend, but he also didn't know the different items on the wine list, insisting that I order the more expensive pinot gris as opposed to the pinot grigio (he later acknowledged his mistake but I found something else to order at that time).  I also felt that he was rushing us at times.

Finally, I appreciate the fact that K-Paul's doesn't discriminate, but when you're paying over $30 for an entree, you expect the restaurant and atmosphere to have a certain level of class.  The party that was seated a couple of tables over from us was not only dressed inappropriately for such a nice restaurant (seriously, leave your 12 pairs of beads at home buddy), but was very loud and frankly, didn't know how to act appropriately in a nice restaurant (the guy would get up and bang on the table while still semi-drunk).

We walk a few blocks, I smell BBQ and we're at New World Brewery, a first for me.  I see the board. ""BBQ Buffet @ $6.50lb!""  As I live a healthy lifestyle, I usually do a sample platter approach to buffets, keep my portion control intact, and get to enjoy the choices put out there.

I pretty much sampled what I thought would be different. I left the mashed potatoes and a couple of other sides that I wasn't in the mood for.
 
I did try the Curry Potato Salad which I will definitely hit next time! The Macaroni Salad was nice as were the collards greens! The cole slaw was vinegar based and that's not my preference. The Jambalaya in a white gravy? This is a New World interpretation. I'm a purist so this is more a chowder. 

Now the BBQ! The smoker is outside in the courtyard. You cant help but smell it as soon as you're half block away. I chose the pulled pork and sausage. There's a lot of good smokey flavor in both. The sausage was quite mild. The pork was righteous! Four sauces are available, Texas Smoke,  Carolina Gold, Mississippi Honey, & Kansan City Classic! I liked the Texas & Honey mixed. Thatr's the fun of having choices of sauces. I lived in NC BBQ Country so the Gold was initially not what I was expecting. It did grow on me and, in the end, I liked it!

Apple Cobbler was the single dessert offering. A warm crisp light crust, filling not too sweet with nice sized apple slices provided a perfect ending to a surprising BBQ lunch buffet. For my accompanying beverage, Clay, our bartender and server recommended Stiegl Radler, a beer with fresh soda mix of grapefruit, light for the summer. He also added ice to a glass as this poured from a can. He was most helpful and made us feel at home. A great lunch!

One day while I was craving Italian I decided to get some Marco Polos for lunch since its only a mile away and not 10 like the Olive Garden. (I actually like Olive Garden, so for those seeking true italian food and etc, you're looking at wrong yelper) 

The service was really quick and my food was ready in about 10 minutes from when I ordered. Just like the guy that took my order said!

I ordered the bruschetta, the fried calamari, and the Farfalle Marco Polo which is basically bowtie pasta tossed with smoked salmon and baby scampi in a  pink cognac cream sauce. The fried calamari was average but you can't really go wrong with fried calamari, I would have appreciated tartar sauce instead of the marinara that it came with but its fine. The bruschetta was also average, it wasn't bad but the flavors were kinda weak for me to rank it above average. The Farfalle Marco Polo which sounds great on the menu was disappointing and underwhelming. You would think a dish named after the restaurant would have more of an impact instead of being bland as it was. You could have substituted the pink cognac cream sauce with hot water and salt and I wouldn't have noticed a difference. 

I prob won't be going back for a while unless Im seriously craving Italian and can't wait 20-30 minutes for Olive Garden.  Like the previous yelpers mentioned maybe the quality has deteriorated since Chef Lo left, its unfortunate I didn't have a chance to try his cooking when he was there.",2009-05-17 01:47:59

Kind of a wannabe-classy establishment, with music that's blaring loud on a Wednesday night and super dark to hide the chips in the odd Roman bath-type walls and floors theme they've got going on.  It's kinda charming in a dirty city way, though.

Overall, the meal and hookah was a pleasant experience.  Hummus was pretty basic, but it definitely wasn't enough for the heaping pile of pita bread, which could have been much softer.  Fried calamari was good, nothing special, but the hidden fried pieces of jalapeno peppers left a bad taste on my palate. The lamb kibobs over rice with some type of yogurt sauce was actually pretty excellent, so I was pleased with that.  Boyfriend's whiskey sour drankkk was done right, so that's a plus.

Got the mango hookah and went through a couple coals.  Pretty nice, though I'd like to try the other flavors they had, specifically Fuzzy Lemonade.  Sounds intriguing.

Overall, I'd go back, but I'd still prefer Fez, where you can unwind and relax on the plush couches and throw pillows, rather than sit upright in an uncomfortable chair on a hard marble table.

Or maybe I should say: Where the heck have I been? Because apparently, lots of people have been to Half Liter, and lots of people love it. Though I'm late to the game, I'm glad I discovered this restaurant, and I'm sure I'll be back many times.

One important thing to know, right from the start, is that Half Liter is an offshoot of Liter House. They both occupy the same building, but they are on different sides. One side is the barbecue section (Half Liter), where it's a little more laid back and you order at the counter. This is where most of the families were (and where my family decided to go). On the other side is Liter House, where they serve German-style food, and it's a more traditional restaurant. 

We decided to visit Half Liter, the barbecue side, and the thing over on this side is that you find your own table, write down orders for alcoholic drinks and clip them to a stand at your table, and then order your food at the counter. This ordering system wasn't my favorite, because someone came to take my beer order as my husband was at the counter ordering food, so the server had to coordinate with the person taking my husband's order to make sure my drink was included on the tab. If that sounds confusing, it is, and like I said, it's not my favorite, but the food makes up for the convoluted ordering system.

The food! Specifically: the ribs! I could eat multiple racks of Half Liter's fall-off-the-bone ribs all day long. They were the best thing that we ordered, and I see myself coming back for future orders of ribs. They were smoky, slightly sticky and tender -- all of the things you want from ribs.

We also got the Eddie's Melt, which is smoked pork, collard greens, pimento cheese and caramelized onions. So much meat! If you're looking for a substantial sandwich with a lot of meat in it, get this one. It was delicious. 

We had kids with us, so we also ordered off the kids menu. The kids cheeseburger was fine: The server specifically made a point to tell us that it's not anything special -- just a burger between a bun that they keep warmed in a warming tray. But kids don't care. My kids didn't care. As long as it looks like a burger and it doesn't have anything spicy on it or anything extra, then they are happy. It wasn't the best kids cheeseburger, but it did the job.

This restaurant can get loud from all the people talking and enjoying their meals, but Half Liter keeps the music at a decent level, which I appreciate! (As I get older and more of a curmudgeon, there's nothing that ruins a dining experience faster than overly loud music.) The service is also very fast and not overly obtrusive.",2019-03-10 17:54:15

No -- there's no popping to be done here, nor is anything quick. You need to block out at least 45 minutes to an hour when you visit, because it takes an absurd amount of time to get your food. From the time I ordered my lunch special to the time they put it down on my table, 30 minutes had passed. Thirty minutes for a fast-casual meal during the work week! I should have read the other reviews before I visited, as other people have had a similar experience.

I had ordered my meal to dine in, but by the time I actually got my food, I had to throw it into a to-go container and run out the door because I had an appointment to get to. I had no idea it would take that long to get my food, otherwise I would have went somewhere else for lunch. This is why I'm telling you (nay, warning you): If you want to have an enjoyable visit to Joella's, you need to go into this place knowing that it's going to take a long time. 

The lunch special is chicken strips, a side and a drink. I got the mashed potatoes and gravy and a lemonade. From what I tasted of my food as I was eating it in my car as I was driving, it tasted really good. It's a shame I couldn't have enjoyed my meal while sitting at a table like a normal person. I dunked my chicken strips into the mashed potatoes like a dipping sauce because I had no other way of eating it, but it actually turned out to be a good decision because the chicken strips and mashed potatoes go really well together.",2019-03-07 13:40:46

You see, I am a donut fiend, and I try every donut when possible. I've eaten a lot of donuts in Indy. Pana Donuts are it. These are the donuts. It sucks that they are so far away, though -- past Beech Grove and almost to Southport. But, I will drive to Pana to get their donuts, because they are worth the drive. 

My go-to donut when I'm trying a new donut joint is the glazed twist. It's a simple donut, but it's easy to get it wrong. Pana got it so right. It was fluffy, soft and fresh (even though we visited in the afternoon!), glazed and chewy yet had a slight give at the ends. It was a perfect glazed twist. I don't even know what else to say to you guys except you need to go to Pana and get some donuts.

So, I got a glazed twist, and my husband got a Boston eclair that he said was ""beautiful."" Who even says that about donuts? My kids got a strawberry iced sprinkle donut and a vanilla iced sprinkle donut. Now, my kids love donuts but they almost never finish their donuts. But these donuts? They ate them all. 

Pana labels all their donuts in the display case, so you know what they all are and can easily order what you want. I don't know why more donut places don't do this. All the donuts are arranged neatly and everything is visually pleasing.

It began with an error on my husband's part. When he called to place a reservation, he failed to mention that it was our wedding anniversary. Upon arrival, we were seated in the center area, where there were families with children eating. I asked if we could be moved to the (empty) private table. We were told that that table was unavailable. I mentioned it was our wedding anniversary and the hostess said she would, ""see what she could do."" She did end up moving us. Amazing how it magically became available.
Anyhow.. We ordered a variety of things-- chips, wagyu beef cheek potato skins, seafood shells, and bread and butter. The chips were divine. Very flavorful and crisp. The potato skins, while not my favorite, were my husband's dream come true. The seafood shells were subpar. Very fishy flavor (which I totally understand is the intention), but it ended up tasting more like tuna casserole. The delicious seafood additions could not properly shine through. The bread and butter had a topping (veggie.. fruit.. root???) that my husband refused to it. It did leave a bit of a weird aftertaste.
We noticed the table behind us kept getting ""complimentary"" items. We got one... A bite of bread with some spread on top. 
We ended up ordering a dessert and two cappuccinos. The dessert was good.. chocolate hazelnut something. The cappuccinos were terrible. I left mine untouched and my husband tried to slug his down.
After spending well over $100, we hit up McDonald's and Starbucks. We needed to fill our bellies and get our caffeine fix.

We definitely had some good chuckles about my plans to visit the Institute. Luckily, it's a bar and not someplace where people seek mental help. Although, I can't help but think about those scenes from TV shows and movies where patrons gush their personal details to a bartender over a stiff beverage. 

In any event, this establishment couldn't be any more chill. From the bar cat to the classic graffiti in the single stall bathroom, it was your quintessential, local watering hole. 

The draft beer selection was just okay. They have 16 lines, with 13 in use during my visit. Nothing really stood out so I opted to go the can route. Interestingly, they don't have bottles, just cans. The can list was solid but nothing too crazy. It reminded me of the cans available in the new Whole Foods.

The service was a little Jekyll and Hyde. The bartender was nice and helpful. The server was a little gruff.

We both agreed it was one of the most fabulous dinners we have experienced in many years.  Certainly the best new American meal we have ever eaten.

Lansdowne is an unusual place for a fine restaurant.  No one thinks of it as a restaurant town.  It was the glowing reviews on Yelp that finally put Sycamore on my radar.

We were seated right on time for a 7:00 reservation.  The room was slightly less than half full.  The décor is rustic, warm, and casual.  The wait staff was in jeans.  

Sycamore is BYOB but they have a ""Cocktail Mixer Menu.""  You bring the liquor and they make wonderful drinks sized for two ($8).  Check the web site for the selection.  We tried the La Paloma and the Indian Ocean and they were both wonderful.  

To begin our meal we tried the Farmer's Plate.  This is a selection of three cheeses and two meats accompanied by an amazing selection of .accoutrements.  You can select the meats and cheeses yourself from a short list.  This is not to be missed!  When ours arrived the beautiful presentation and our moans of pleasure caused two other tables to order it immediately.  

We ordered delicious Spaghetti alla Carbonara as an appetizer and prepared for the entrees.

The entrees are limited at the Sycamore and change frequently.  It's important to check the website.  The wife enjoyed Seared Duck Magret and I devoured Red Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs.  This is new American cuisine at its finest!  We finished the meal with the wife's favorite desert; Tiramisu.

Our evening included mixers for four drinks, Farmer's Plate, one appetizer, two entrees and one desert.  We were pleasantly satiated and the tab was a very reasonable $108.

These folks have been around for over twenty years.  Whatever you call them they serve up some tasty food.  I'm working just down the street right now so I gave them a try.  I try not to review a pizza joint unless I've visited at least twice and that was the case here.

They are located just a few feet from the intersection of Lancaster and Wayne Aves.  Directly in front of them are a few parking species marked ""ten minute pickup parking"" with no meters and that's nice.

Each time I visited the place was spotless.  This is a take-out only family-run place with just a few chairs for sitting while you wait for your order.

Day#1
Of course I was going to try the pizza. Its Greek pizza here so all you Italian pizza snobs can stop rolling your eyes and making those funny snorting noises!  I ordered two slices with sausage and they made it fresh.  They happened to make it from a small pie and when they do that they double your order so I was given four small slices.  The crust was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of topping.  The cheese was particularly tasty.  This is a thin crust pizza joint.  My ""4"" small slices and a 20 oz. soda cost me $8 and change and it was an excellent lunch.

Day#2
This time I tried an Italian Grinder.  It was fresh and tasty and most importantly hot all the way through.  I hate when you order a grinder and they are cold in the middle!  The tab was $7.53 and once again an excellent lunch.

On each visit I'm betting the Greek lady that cashed me out was the mother of this family.  She was excellent and really makes you feel welcome.  For a ""New"" place they seriously have their act together!",2015-04-04 20:53:17

But wait, the place is super casual with very casual furnishings.  There is no way it feels like a gastro pub.  What is this place?

So I order a Braised brisket Sandwich for $9.75.  It arrives quickly and the toasted soft roll is to die for.  The brisket, not so much.  It's over cooked and a little tough and fatty.  The entire plate was quite small including a tiny cup of coleslaw and a few chips.  Maybe I shouldn't bitch so much for $9.75.  It may have had ""smoky sautéed onions"" on it but there was no way in hell it was anything but a three star casual sandwich.

They have a bigger platter that includes the same stuff plus pancakes or French toast for $6.99.  After eating that it would be kind of embarrassing if I had to waddle out to my car.

I was told that it may be too crowded, and to go to some other place if it was. But there was a spot right there on the patio. I was mainly looking for beer, but we were hungry.
Parking was a bit atrocious, but it's more the neighborhood than anything. It was also very difficult to get in to the area. We ended up only about a block away though, in a free spot.
The patio is nice enough, but features cheap lawn furniture. I'm not looking for white table cloths, but when my chair is from Wal-Mart and cost less than half what I'm paying for my meal, it's annoying. But I'm glad we were outside because of what the inside looked like: dank is the word I'd use. Everything was dark, musty and kind of strange. If they were going for the British pub look, they didn't succeed. The size of the bar really disappointed me: it's supposed to be a brewpub, so why have a bar that's only 5' or so long?
And that should have signaled to me, right there, that this is the sort of brewpub that focuses on food, not beer, because that seems to be the case. The beer wasn't awful, but everything was very safe, and a lot of it just wasn't very good. I was impressed that they did nitro/cask pours, but they were served cold.
I was told later, by a local bartender who also spoke highly of this place, that their beer is supposed to be more English style. That actually redeems the beer in my mind a little, because it makes sense why some of them tasted as they did. But they're still not good.
The food also was not good. I mean, it wasn't bad, where I'd throw it down and say ""This is awful"" and refuse to eat it, but it was just so mediocre. I got the sausage sandwich, which was served with sauerkraut from the can on a slightly stale roll. And the sausage was undercooked. I got the mashed potatoes for a side, which were good, but were topped with a watery gravy that looked, had the consistency of, and tasted more like sweet coffee than anything.
My companion got the vegetarian sloppy joe, which was more like vegetarian chili than anything. She got a side of the vegetables, which were undercooked.
The service was relatively slow throughout the meal but the girl was nice, until I asked about a charge at the end of the meal. Both of our standard sides had been fries, but we both decided to change. I noticed (the list of sides along with their prices are at the bottom of the menu) that my mashed potatoes with gravy were $0.25 more than the standard fries, while my companion's veggies were the same price. On the ticket, instead of being upcharged $0.25, I was charged the full $1.75. The server said that this was how it was and it was more a fluke that my companion wasn't charged than me being charged. My whole thing: if you're going to charge the full price for a side substitution, then give me the other side. It's just fair. But we protested and she huffed off, not to return for about 10 minutes after that.
I was also irked by the sampler price: $1.25 each, which added up to $10. $10 for eight samples? That seems high, and it would have been nice to know that beforehand.
We could have gotten away with ""That place kind of sucked"" and left it there, but the issue with the ticket, and the fact that I had been deliberately led here by others left me feeling so slighted that I started saying ""I should say something to the manager."" I'm not the type to usually talk to the manager. In fact, I've done it all of twice in my recent memory: once here and once at the worst Boston Market I'd ever encountered in suburban Atlanta, where I told the guy that his franchise should be taken away and that he should be ashamed of his operation. Here, I just mentioned that it was a bad experience all around and that he should consider worked on the sampler pricing, because $10 is absurd for the quality of that beer. I had already paid, and wanted nothing but to give them feedback that I hoped would help them.
Will it? Probably not, because this place is so busy that they don't really need me and they don't need my feedback. I'm sure I was written off as just a self-righteous asshole. I would offer this to readers though: there are four brewpubs in the Broad Ripple area so, if you're looking to patronize one for dinner, your options are not limited and are much better elsewhere.
1*, but 2* when I realized that the beer was supposed to be English style. It would have helped to have known that, just as it would have helped to have known beforehand the sampler pricing. A sign outside saying ""This is going to suck"" also would have been helpful, but not necessary.",2011-05-02 16:32:10

She had ordered the Pigout Tavern Double Burger with their in house made chips.  10 minutes later the manager came by and told us that there was something wrong and that she would pay for the onion tower short stack.  At which point she asked what I had ordered. Wait a minute, you mean to tell me that I placed my order 20 minutes ago and our onion rings 30 minutes ago and you just now tell me something was wrong.  I reminded her that I had ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger with Chipotle Aioli for my side salad.  Well my burger finally showed up but instead of a container full of Chipotle Aioli, there was hardly any, maybe a quarter full (and that is stretching it).  I was well into my burger when our appetizer finally showed up and my daughter was almost done with hers.  They were very hot, but super greasy. The onion rings came with full containers of ranch dressing and their Camp-Fire Mayo dipping sauces.  Kind of what I was expecting with the Chipotle Aioli.  Maybe the Chipotle Aioli is made of gold and the 50 cent up charge for the Chipotle Aioli only gives you so much.  

Bottomless sides means bottomless fries.  As I mentioned before I had a side salad and my daughter had the chips.  We got more fries.  But how can I get more fries, if I didn't want fries.  What about more chips? Or a refill on my salad with some more of that rare Chipotle Aioli.  Sodas were supposed to be unlimited as well, but we were limited to one each.

So, overall the food was just ok.  The burgers only ok and the guacamole was spread so thin that I hardly noticed it was there.  The chips were very dark (almost burnt) and had no flavor.  I guess if you wanted you could have paid for some dipping sauce, but we saw how well that work with the Chipotle Aioli.

It was nice the manager covered our onion rings, but there were other issue here that they need to take care of.  Maybe they were a bit short staffed tonight, but when you watch her punch in the order at the table on a little handheld device, how do you lose two thirds of our order?  I think after this experience we will pass on going back again.",2019-07-18 01:59:52

It's a cozy little restaurant tucked into an aging strip mall on one of the busiest intersections in town. The inside is painted in warm colors and features beautiful paintings which appeared to be by local artists.

The menu is extensive and has many, many dishes that would be good choices. I quickly chose the Francisco's Enchilada Salad, as I have never had anything called an enchilada salad before. It arrived almost immediately -- less than five minutes after I ordered it. This would usually be a good thing during my lunch hour, but it did not bode well for the quality of the food.

The salad was large, fresh, and beautiful, with bright green slices of avocado, crumbles of queso fresco, chicken soaked in red guajillo sauce, tiny halved jalapeños, and topped with crisp tortilla strips. The salad was accompanied by a jar of red salsa that was just piquant enough, without overwhelming the flavor of the dish. Underneath the salad, I found a pair of corn tortillas soaked in the delicious guajillo sauce.

The only real fault with the dish was the chicken, which was slightly dry and slightly tough. When the plate arrived so quickly, my first thought was ""How did they have time to grill the chicken?"" They didn't; it was pre-cooked. And for this, it suffered. Some of the tomatoes were also under-ripe and had hard, flavorless white centers. Every other aspect of the salad was perfect.

Eclectic Cafe's menu is huge and many of their items are unique, at least in my experience. The fast service got me back to work with 20 minutes to spare in my lunch hour and while this would usually be a benefit, I would have waited that extra 20 minutes if it had meant better chicken. Still, I would be happy to return to Eclectic and sample more of their local delights.",2014-10-01 16:11:34

I was really looking forward for this place to open. They did a lot of work in the building formally called the schoolhouse. They built a huge deck out front, and added lots of wood and TVs inside. Its pretty nice and does have a New England feel. Now, I realize this is a Boston themed restaurant, but the Red Sox and Patriots stuff was too much. You're in FL now, so maybe some support for OUR teams too would be nice. I'm not letting let bias my review.

We started with a beer. Decent beers, moderately priced ($4-$6) and a full cocktail list. Our server gave us the wrong beers. I know you're new, but something like getting the right drink doesn't take months of on the job training. 

On to the food. They were out of lobster so we couldn't try the bisque. We decided to start with the ""stuffies"". The clams were chewy and inedible. Gross really. The rest of the menu was extremely basic bar food. They had a few special seafood dishes, but not enough to stand out. For our entrees, I got a buffalo chicken wrap, and my boyfriend got the fisherman's seafood platter.  My wrap was just a notch above the mcdonalds snack wrap: dry and boring. The fries were good. The $20 seafood platter wasn't much better. The claims were horrible. They were so chewy they tasted frozen, or not cooked right. There was also only 2 shrimp on the plate.  I don't mind spending money on quality food. But if I can go to the grocery store and buy frozen claim strips and popcorn shrimp and be more satisfied than with a restaurant meal, we have a problem. 

I left $70 poorer, and dissatisfied. I feel like the mistakes were too much that I can't chalk them up to this place being new. I won't be coming back. Do yourself a favor and choose one of the many BETTER pubs within a 10 minute drive. I give this place less than a year.

We also had omelettes ($9-10) which aren't huge but are very nicely made and tasty. They come with delicious grilled French bread and grits, which you should just throw into the trash because they're congealed, unseasoned and straight gross. Everything else is good though.

We started with a bunch of things: deviled eggs (yum), cornbread, shrimp tacos and fried biscuits - all excellent except for the biscuit things which ended up like hush puppies, kind of dry and boring. They'll definitely size appetizers to suit the size of your party which is really nice.

I will say however, the queso fundido with chorizo was delicious! This was the highlight of my meal, the appetizer. The shots were also on point and my Corona Light was cold.

They were using a special menu, according to my friends, which didn't offer all the usual selections. Which I could understand seeing how busy they were. One of my friends told me it also seemed like the prices were higher than usual. Not cool!

I have had a few burgers at BBP but right now my favorite is the Buffalo Style...crunchified. It has the prefect amount of hot sauce and cheese. The other burgers I have tried at BBP have all been good also.  What BPP excels at is their toppings. The are fairly unique and the flavors work together well.

We started with the crab fritters. These were similar to a crab hushpuppy and not greasy at all. There are not too many foods much better then Crab and fried bread! I had the Burger which is 100% grass fed local beef, butchered & ground at Kensington Quarters topped with a 6yr. Rustic cheddar, lettuce, & onion stout jam on a Snowflake bun. This cheese and bun were excellent and the burger was juicy. My daughter had the  Kielbasa & Pierogies - House smoked Polish sausage served with our potato pierogies, sauerkraut, and hot mustard.

Opted for the ""Giant Half Pound Cheesesteak for 10.99.""  Our fearless leader tried the ""Pepper & Thyme crusted filet mignon sandwich for $14.99"".
 First appearance when they brought out the platters was ""WOW""!  I keep it simple with fried onions and ketchup.  They say half pound of meat and I'm thinking it was more.  Some places advertise with words like ""jumbo"" or ""big"" and ""giant"" and inevitably disappoint.  Not this place!  Picture tell the story better than I can describe.   The cheesesteak was a mix of ribeye and brisket chopped well with the cheese melted in nicely.  There was a hint of smokiness from the brisket.  The final product was moist and tender on a butter toasted Liscio roll.  The whole thing worked well together.   The filet cheesesteak was very good but I wasn't a fan of either the seasoning or the arugula.  The meat was tender and would have been great with simple salt and pepper.  Nothing wrong with it just a personal preference.  In addition order Red neck egg rolls (love the name).  It was filled with pulled pork and cole slaw.  Served with cue sauce which later found out is barbecue sauce and Japanese mayo.  Nice taste to it with just a little heat.  Excellent condiment for the egg rolls and probably will slather it on my left over cheesesteak today.
We got talking to The manager and Tiffany who cooked this amazing food for us.  They encouraged us to try their barbecue food next time, but as we explained we were on a cheesesteak adventure.

We had to wait about 30-40 minutes. They squeezed the 6 of us around a table for 4. This one has been on my list for a while so I was looking forward to trying it. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Platter (Stacked corn tortillas with cheese and chile sauce. Served with rice and beans) and was given the choice of red chile, green chile, or Christmas style (both.) Was there any other option? Of course I went with Christmas style. This was a delicious and flavorful plate of food. Everything on the plate was well spiced and the cheese was smooth and creamy. I didn't love the rice. My brother ordered the Carne Adovada (Red chile braised local pork shoulder, 2 eggs, home fries and tortillas.) I thought the pork shoulder was well seasoned, tender, and delicious. I would order it myself. My boyfriend ordered the Jonathan's Famous Fiery Scramble (Spicy, cheesy, scrambled eggs with sausage, home fries and biscuit.) He requested light spice and felt the food was still spicy but very much enjoyed his meal. Other orders were one of the egg combos, a breakfast sandwich, and the buttermilk cornmeal pancakes. The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and the service is friendly.

My issues were the long wait time and the fact that they squeezed our party of 6 around a table for 4. The host even commented that we were all very tall. I'm not tall (5'6""). I'm the short one but the rest of the party is 6'4"", 6'2"", and 3 women at 5'10"". Also the place is crowded and loud.

Walked in...yep...TONS of frog decorations. I was thinking to myself, it must be nice to be so enthralled with something that whenever you see that thing at a craft show or store, you just buy it and put it in your restaurant!

So, now for the experience. The place was VERY busy for Sunday brunch at 11:00am. However, we only waited about 25 minutes and were shocked at how the zipped people in. It must be a big deal here in Florida, but we had coffee in our cups before we even met our waiter. So, perks for the fast coffee service (and he came around every so often to refill too). It took a little while for the server to great us the first time, but once he did, the service was very good and quick. 

I had french toast and home fries. The french toast was on the better end of the spectrum as far as french toast goes. Thick and fluffy and a rectangle instead of a square. Oh, and they gave me like 6 or 7 pieces....it was A LOT of french toast. And did I mention that the home fries are TO DIE FOR? I didn't? Well, they're to die for! Some kind of spice on them that made them extra delicious. 

My friend ordered some kind of crazy egg dish with peppers and cheese and a whole bunch of stuff, and she was enjoyed it way much. She was also VERY impressed with the home fries. 

Only flaw was that the coffee was on the weaker side.

The place is right across the street from the water, but there's a giant apartment, hotel, or condo complex blocking the view of the water, but it's there and you can kind of see it, plus, you get to see some crazy big beach front homes as you're driving up to the restaurant. Small parking lot in front and a bigger one in the back. Casual attire, and, yes, there are a handful of ""regulars"" that are probably at The Frog Pond regularly, but I think it's mostly first timers or people staying in the area, so don't be intimidated if the staff doesn't know you ;).

I ordered one of my favorite dishes the Cedar Plank Salmon which came out burnt on the outside with burnt lemon wedges as garnish. So bad I had to flip the lemons over to salvage the pic. Before I ordered I asked for it to be cooked medium medium rare like it usually is at Plymouth Meeting, and it seemed almost purposely the server brought out this burnt salmon. Why be so malicious towards customers? 

I love the garlic aioli that used to come with it but its not available right now with the new post COVID menu. This is something I feel the server could have mentioned to me while ordering as I mentioned I come  here often so I didn't read in detail the description. I usually dip my salmon and asparagus in the aioli and it's my favorite part of the dish. 

The Cornbread still taste good but for some reason I don't remember it having actual Corn  pieces in it...? Maybe I forgot, but I could do without the corn inside. 

I also ordered my usual buffalo shrimp which was $17.50 and I only received 4 pieces instead of the usual full order of 6. There is also no option for a half order of 3 neither anymore. The new limited COVID menu is frustrating to any long time goers because the menu isn't huge to begin with and there also no weekly specials. I think I'll just go back once their menu is back to normal. Biggest plus is my Redstone Manhattan  still taste pretty good just a little stronger than usual and it's already a strong drink. 


The server was very indifferent throughout the entire meal, and did not act like he cared about us enjoying ourselves at all. He actually brought down the mood it was so bad.

Said I couldn't, so the girl (honey,sweetie,baby, were her favorite words) said to hold on a minute, and she would take my order. 

I drove from Cleary and Airline on hold, and hung up when I got to the drive up window. 

Placed my order, paid, and gave a tip. 

I waited 35 minutes, and never got food. So I rolled over the bell, and the same girl came out to take my order. I told her I was still waiting for my order.  

She went to the other side of the restaurant and came back a few minutes later with my food. I asked if was still hot. She said, yeah, we had to wait for the chili. She also gave me 6 glazed donuts--complimentary. (Thanks!)

I drove off and realized I did not get my drinks. 
I got home 6 minutes later, and the burgers and fries and even the chili were all cold.

Finally we made a visit and we were all highly disappointed.

It's a seat yourself place and even though the inside is decorated with plenty of things to keep your attention, I choose a table for our group outside.  I should have known by the fact that all the empty tables had not been bussed that it was a bad idea.  I chose the table with the least amount of left over cups/plates/napkins thinking somebody would come over to wipe it up fairly shortly.  However we sat there for a good 10 minutes before seeing anybody who worked there bring out a pizza to the table next to us.  She stopped and asked if anybody had been by to take our drink order.  She politely took our drink order and also our appetizer order and walked away.

After that a blonde girl came by and asked if our drink order was taken, we told her yes and then she disappeared.  Our appetizers ended up coming out 15 minutes later by the same girl who took our drink & appetizer order but we still hadn't gotten our drinks.  Finally the blonde girl came back with drinks and began to walk away but I was able to ask her for plates, napkins and for our table wiped off.  She looked stunned and confused as to why I was asking.  She came back carrying the plates pressed up against her body while juggling 2 drinks for another table and the whole time I'm thinking awesome my plate that I'm going to eat off of was just pushed against your t-shirt and god only knows where that's been.

After she half-assed cleaned our table, she asked if we were ready to order or need a few more minutes.  By now we've been there a good 25 minutes, so I'm pretty sure we've been able to look over the menu and if you don't know what you want pick something now because who knows when she'll be back.

Our food came out quickly by yet another server/food runner/whoever.  Food was pretty good - I had the Turkey Meltdown with the side salad.  Good size portions for the price.  Also our table got the Rocket Tots as an appetizer and I'd definitely pass on them in the future, nothing special.

After our meal, our waitress finally showed up again and asked if we were ready for the check.  One of us asked for a to-go box, which she of course forgot. I was definitely glad to pay for my meal and get the heck out of there.

The couple seated at the table next to us had to get up to track down the waitress several times.  Once to get the other part of their order because apparently they ordered more than just pizza, another time to get silverware after the lady had asked the waitress when she brought the second dish, another time to get drink refills and then finally to get their check and a to-go box.  During our table's time there, the only time the waitress came to their table was to drop off the second meal.

All in all service was horrible.  It completely ruined my experience of the STL Flying Saucer.  I would have been more forgiving if there was a rush and the place was busy, but after the couple left next to us there was only our table of 3 and another larger table, who had ordered before us.

They definitely need to get their service in check, hopefully they have their A-Team servers working on during Cardinal's games and leave the C squad for the weekday lunch crowd.  May or may not be back in the future, I might just make the drive to Memphis or KC if I'm ever craving Flying Saucer.",2013-05-22 20:12:17

I don't like rating an entire business because of one person.

In this case, the service was so poor and the server so unapologetic that it soured the whole experience.  

She was rude, short-tempered, forgetful, and extremely slow.  She forgot to place our order, was incapable of getting the correct drinks, barely checked on the table and was extremely, extremely, extremely slow.  

She also added drinks to the various bills at the table, and was unable to properly divide the bill, even though we told her several times we needed separate bills.  Finally, she refused to correct the extra drinks on the bill and made excuses about where the manager was.  We finally just paid for the extra beers as we just wanted to leave.  

I do believe she did all this on purpose as well. I was able to watch the other tables she waited on and those that arrived after us had drinks and food well ahead of us.  She was very attentive and prompt with the other tables as well.

The staff was friendly enough; that wasn't the issue.  It was the food, drinks and cleanliness of the establishment that turned us off to a return visit.   Our visit:  We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant was less that 20 percent full.  I ordered Iced Tea and the Met Salad.  I asked for grilled chicken on the salad instead of friend chicken and was told that was ""no problem""---only to learn when the bill arrived that this $12.95 salad had a $2.00 additional charge ($14.95) for simply changing the chicken from fried to grilled.   The salad, while edible, was definitely not worth $14.95.    

My iced tea was so weak that I thought it was water (you couldn't tell through the red plastic glasses).  When I told the waitress, she said that ""everyone complains about our iced tea""  I asked if it was brewed tea and she said that it was.  I sent it back and replaced it with a diet Pepsi.   Seriously, how can a DELI not have decent iced tea and instead has tea that ""everyone complains about"" per the waitress.

Two strikes.  

My lunch companion order the bagel and lox (for $15.75) and said that it was unremarkable.  In fact, the lox had brown edges that had to be trimmed before he could eat it.  He said it was the worst bag and lox he can ever remember having.

Three strikes and I'm not done...

I used the Men's room and was disgusted at how filthy it was.  It had clearly not been cleaned in a while.  The window on the door to the mens room was covered with ""crud"" ---finger prints, and other sticky residue.  The floor was dirty and clearly hadn't been washed in a while.  And the area above the urinal was disgusting as well.   I believe that the state of the restrooms in a restaurant says a lot about how the kitchen is most likely maintained.   I would urge the Pima County Health Department to make a surprise inspection, because I bet the Kitchen would not pass muster if the cleanliness of the rest of the establishment is any indicator.    Also, the menu's we were given were sticky---clearly they are not cleaned between patrons.  (Can you say GERMS???)

Bottom line:  We left after paying a $35.00 bill vowing to never return and feeling that we had experienced one of the worst dining experiences ever in Tucson.   We dine out at least three times per week so have a significant base of comparison.

Hopefully, the management will take my criticisms to heart and clean up the establishment; clean menus before re-using, make Iced Tea that doesn't taste like water and tell customers when there is a charge for a substation of grilled chicken instead of fried.",2016-12-04 22:13:29

And by highly recommended, I mean, enthusiasm coupled with sparkling eyes and a really painful slap on my shoulder (I had a bruise the day after!). That enthusiasm for anything gets me equally enthused so of course we simply had to go!

The good thing about Gene's is that they are open 24 hours, so I imagine they are a godsend after a long night of partying and/or drinking. Also, it feels very much a neighborhood joint so you don't have to deal with ""those tacky tourists"" much. 

Now, I don't eat red meat so that makes Gene's menu very, very limited for me.  Everybody raves about the hot sausage (beef, said the guy in the counter) poboy, but I could only have the ham and cheese poboy (I know! I know! Who in their right mind does that? Well I was hungry at 3 in the morning!). Well it is nothing special, I can assure you. However, the bread is really very good. I kept imagining how good a poboy would it have been had I been able to choose shrimp or oysters instead (no seafood poboys at Gene's).

But what made me rate this establishment from ""Meh"" to ""A-OK"" is the experience. First off, the guy behind the counter was really very pleasant and kept chatting with us. He even gave me advice on how I can speed and not get a ticket (""Just bawl your eyes out, baby!"").  There were a few Belgians who came in while we were waiting who looked frankly bewildered that the place their concierge raved about was *this* place and looked suspicious of the clientele. Not that I could blame them -- a number of drunks were at Gene's. In the space of 20-25 minutes, overall rambunctiousness (paired with conversations ranging from freaking hilarious to quite philosophical to nearly violent outbursts) ruled the place. It was an interesting way to end the evening.

So go for the experience, if not for the poboy.",2012-08-24 00:24:43

The coffee is strong and served in proper diner mug.  Eggs in abundance, both traditional forms and some creative iron-skillet dishes.  

The Orleans Slammer is an iron pan full of bacon, beans, and eggs, prepared as you like it.  In my case, the over-easy egg had stayed on the grill too long and the yolk was cooked through.  That was a disappointment, as I was looking at this dish as a kind of huevos rancheros.  The cheese fries had a lighter dusting of cheese than what's typical. That's good for your calorie count but not exactly why one is ordering cheese fries in the first place.  

The coffee,  good, strong, and dark, was refilled quickly until the burgeoning crowd demanded too much of the server both in terms of both time and ability to get to our table. Crowds are a problem here.  On most weekends you can expect to wait, and then once in the restaurant the place is buzzing with people.  That gives it a lively atmosphere, but also means that carafe of coffee is less likely to come your way when you want it--and when you're at a diner on Saturday morning, you really want it.

It's easy enough to scope out the crowd situation from the street, though.  If there are legions of pale-looking people milling around the sidewalk, keep driving or stay on the bus.

The check took a long time to arrive, all while we endured the haunting stares of hungry people outside on the sidewalk (truly, a first world problem).  Another long time passed as we waited to get change back, as it's cash only here.  New Orleans, of course, is not known for its punctuality, but when a meal is finished and it's time to settle up, but even the least punctual New Orleanian wants to squirm with an empty coffee cup while a line of hungry people glowers.  

This all sounds harsh, but consider it counterpoint to the obvious and sustained popularity of Slim Goodies.  The large menu offers a lot of choices beyond just a plain omelette or eggs and toast.  Go, but try to pick a less busy time.",2014-10-03 22:09:01

Just came back from a dinner with friends and probably had the worst pizza I've ever had in my life!  We ordered a Margarita pizza, the first one was totally burnt. I understand that with a wood-burning oven there can be a little Char, but this was far beyond a little char-- it was black & burnt over most of the pizza. 

The waiter must have known it was a Turd because he just dropped it and ran.  Of course, we had no plans to eat it and immediately requested a replacement.   Sadly, the second pizza that came out wasn't much better and the quantity and quality of toppings were a joke.

My friends ordered one of the basic pizzas with cheese, sausage and mushrooms; perhaps the kitchen was short on ingredients because again there was hardly any toppings on this pizza. 

Let me be clear, I'm Italian, I'm not expecting the American Pizza loaded with toppings when I go to a place that boasts an Italian style pizza. I get what an Italian pizza is and THIS wasn't it.

There are hundreds of restaurants in this town where you can get a great meal and for a fraction of the price.  The portions are too small and the prices are too high.

How much could this cost?  A 5th shrimp would have been nice too.  I loved the dressing, however, and even though I am not a fan of this particular green it was a delicious dish.  The food isn't haute cuisine where you get 8 very small courses of unbelievable food so show us some hospitality and feed us.

 I also ordered the snapper over about 2 tablespoons of shrimp étouffée and about the same amount of rice.  The plate pointed to how small the portion was.  The dish was nice, not seasoned very well, but the fish was fresh and although a little tough around the edges I enjoyed it.  I would go back if someone else was paying but otherwise would definitely pass given so many opportunities for a better meal.  

They gave us a Christmas Eve gift of a oven mitt and a bag of the biscuit mix that stated it needed to be refrigerated.  I didn't know that we were the only people in the restaurant that were traveling and couldn't accommodate it.  I guess it's the thought that counts.  Hmmmm.",2012-12-25 14:47:23

The service, the iced tea, and the fact you can eat al fresco is good, but overall I do not think the presentation and the food is anything to brag about for the price you pay",2011-10-28 11:53:43

I had been to the previous restaurant in the space, and it was much cozier this time around, although I find the window next to our seat to be strange. It was a window to the entryway and it was slightly higher than our heads, and every time people were in the vestibule waiting we felt like we were in an aquarium.

However! Last-minute tables were to be had at 7:30 on a Friday evening, and people need to get on this band wagon. The food here is excellent. My BFF and I started with cocktails- she went with the cucumber elderflower and gin cocktail and I requested a gin sour. Hers was tasty, very much cucumber, and mine was good as well although slightly too tart. They were not lacking for gin, though, and when I got home after having two of them I was pretty drunk.

House-baked bread and butter came to the table pretty quickly, and it was good bread, but the butter was too cold and they never brought out more bread after we finished the first two pieces. The water sitch is my other beef: they offer sparkling or still from bottles they carry around, and the water was room temp. If there isn't ice, the water should at least be cold. It made me drink more cocktails, which was likely not a coincidence.

We decided to share everything, so we got the chicken and biscuits, the potato tortellini in a Madeira mushroom sauce, and the vertical roasted chicken, then two desserts to share. The chicken and biscuits is phenomenal and I'd come back over and over again just for that. Savory, warm, and comforting. The biscuits were a little twee, however. The highlight of the pasta was the mushrooms and sauce, but the pasta itself was very good even though it could have used maybe 30 seconds more cooking time. It was like an Italian version of a pierogie.The roasted chicken was insanely moist and tender and all the veggies with it were spot-on.

For dessert we shared the plum clafoutis and the chocolate peanut butter mousse thing. They were both decadent and heavenly. The plum clafoutis would make the world's greatest brunch dish, hot out of the oven with sweet whipped cream.

The total for 4 cocktails, 3 dishes, and 2 desserts was $120 including tip. Not bad at all! We could easily have saved $20 by getting one drink each, but it was a girl's night so who wants to do that? Service was great, the server was new but capable and friendly and didn't rush us out when we lingered over our last cocktails.",2013-10-28 12:42:39

The Khyber Pass Pub, however, is a delightful revamp of a space that probably wasn't pulling in enough revenue to support the costs on such a prime location. B and I met up with some fellow Yelpers for an excellent UYE. It was vegan-themed but B and I went for the awesome BBQ I'd been hearing about.

The draft list was impressive but I was disappointed by their lack of regular IPAs. There were Double IPAs and Imperial IPAs, but I had just come from the gym and wasn't feeling such a heavy beverage. I went with a Jack's Cider and it was perfect, nice and light and refreshing. Bottle list was limited.

For food I chose the 1/2 smoked chicken with debris fries and coleslaw on the side. For gluten-intolerant folks, be warned that the gravy is most likely thickened with flour since I'm not feeling well today, but I didn't ask because I wanted to eat them anyways. Didn't have any of the coleslaw since I can't eat cabbage either, but it looked better than the average. The chicken, however, was beyond delicious. I think I liked it better than Percy Street's, the smokiness had a better flavour somehow and wasn't as overpowering. I think it was the hickory? It went great with my BYO homemade BBQ sauce that I make sans onion and garlic. Yes, I brought a small tupperware of BBQ sauce to the restaurant. Don't judge me.

There was so much food I ended up bringing a whole chicken breast home. Atmosphere is very basic, service did an excellent job handling a large and ever-changing group, doling out separate checks without complaint and they even comped my second drink when it took a long time to arrive. I hadn't noticed because I was having a great time socializing, but I was pleased to get a free drink! Volume was super loud but that could have been because we had so many people in our group. Prices were incredibly reasonable - my enormous entree was only $18 and the ciders were like $5 I think.

Aside from eating, we were looking for fresh mariquitas to take my mother-in-law in the panhandle. Since we hadn't seen it on their online menu, I ask the waitress (in Spanish)  if they have mariquitas ... she stares at me ... turns out Jennifer doesn't speak Spanish nor does the restaurant make plantain chips... *record scratch* I'm taken aback but decide to give it a shot anyway. 

I ordered the half Cuban sandwich with fried plantains and my husband had the half pork sandwich with black beans and rice. Surprisingly,  both had great taste, plantains seemed to be freshly fried and the pork was nicely seasoned. 

Although Jennifer didn't speak Spanish, she was very sweet, attentive and went out of her way to try to get us the mariquitas we were looking for (she came out with bags of Chifles mariquitas, which the kitchen uses ... not what we were looking for but they get points for at least using Chifles brand).

Desserts were ok.  On the Cuban side, they had flan and cheese flan (which I had - it was very yummy).  The other desserts (carrot cake, chocolate cake and a peanut butter and chocolate dessert, which my husband loved) aren't Cuban.  Seems although the restaurant owners are Cuban, none of the cooks are. 

I was a bit disappointed that their menu didn't include the variety I'm used to back in SoFla but we enjoyed what we ordered. I was also surprised that a loaf of Cuban bread goes for $9 - really really steep - that better be some dang good bread for n that price. 

Overall, are they what I expected from an authentic Cuban restaurant?  Not entirely. I'm used to a loud busy eatery with certain staples.  Would we return?  Sure, we'd like to sample other dishes.

Don't order anything else besides that or beer.  I ordered an old-fashioned (wtf was I thinking?) and the bartender threw some crap together that reminded me of college.  He even used his bare hands to rip the orange meat off an orange slice just for the peel.  I just hoped he washed his hands ...

Anyways, the dueling pianos was a blast.  The crowd was mixed, including your bachelorette party, older seniors slamming down a few hurricanes, drunk frat boys pounding beers, and your standard 30's people like my wife and I.  However, everyone was having a super fun time which was awesome.

The food is decent, but nothing exceptional.  Think pub grub from somewhere that hasn't been pointedly noted as having great food.  Fair enough but it won't blow you away.

Cool Ranch or Nacho Cheese Doritos? (the correct answers are Goobers/Pizza Hut and Cool Ranch, by the way) And now we can add, ""Chipotle or Pancheros"" to that mighty list. Well, being well versed in both, and having been to both recently, I'm ready to make MY ruling: Pancheros by a nose.

While at the Moorestown mall yesterday, my GF was going on about how STARVING she was, and suggested a burrito. She wanted to head down the street a little to go to Pancheros, but on our way out, we walked right past Chipotle and I suggest we try there, since she had never been. She was game, and we were off. Let me preface this by saying that BOTH are EXTREMELY good, and you will NOT be disappointed in either burrito. But when both dishes are so evenly matched, it comes down to the details and that is where Chipotle falls behind. 

First thing I noticed (because the misses wanted queso dip) was the lack of said dip at Chipotle. You can only get chips and salsa or chips and guac. No queso was a bit disappointing. 

Secondly, Pancheros gets an extra point for making your tortilla right in front of you. Chipotles tortilla was just as fresh (tasting) but it was just cool to see the dough ball get flattened and turned into your tortilla right in front of you.

Finally, a little detail that actually makes a BIG difference is at Pancheros, after everything is added to your burrito, they mix it all up before wrapping. At Chipotle, they just scoop it on and wrap, which leads to your ingredients being in sections. There were many bites of my Chipotle burrito that were nothing but rice and other bites that had NO rice. 

Both places are made to order with fresh, tasty ingredients but if you are ever in the fantastic position of being able to choose between the two, I say hit Pancheros.",2011-10-23 23:33:10

It's like a driving range/arcade/bar/grill hybrid, that actually really works. It's like Augusta National had a threesome with Dave and Busters and PJ Whelihans. Its like a bowling alley, but with golf. Its a good idea. The execution however, leaves a little to be desired.

I'm not sure if they just haven't worked out the kinks at THIS location, but we went last night, and had an ok time. First, the place is beautiful; bright, clean, spacious. There were greeters at the door and a nice glass waterfall that you see in restaurants that are trying too hard. To the right is a HUGE bar. We are asked to check in and then led to a ""bay"" where we sit down and look things over. 

We are on the second level, and in front of us are multiple colored sarlac pits where you basically try to play darts with golf balls. Its visually very pleasing. And, they have clubs, so all you really need to bring to Top Golf is your wallet. NOW, full disclosure, our night was a little bit different because we were with an employee, but all that really affected was the price. 

The first thing I noticed that was off about Top Golf is the staggering, overarching presence of danger. This is a place that combines a game dominated by frat bro douches, gives them metal clubs, liquors them up and tells them to swing said clubs in mind bendingly close proximity to each other. Yeah, theres a red line that you're not supposed to cross, but the penalty for doing so might just be a fractured skull. And thats the danger on just one side of the mat; on the other, is a precarious drop if you happen to cross the YELLOW line, and fall off the ledge. (There ARE nets, BUT....) There are kids running around, rouge golf balls rolling down the corridors behind you....its just RIFE with potential for injury. The insurance premiums on this place must be ASTRONOMICAL.

Issue #2 is that its overly futuristic. Everything is controlled on your little ipad thing, which, predictably, was wonky throughout. It took about 25 minutes for the guy giving us the schpiel to get everything started. I started to wonder halfway through if this guy even worked there, as he didn't seem to know much about how any of this stuff worked, and the guy we were with that DID work there, said he had never seen this guy in his life. There was massive confusion about which ""card"" was supposed to be used, and theres a different card for that, and that card is not for that...etc, etc. (One of the cards in question is a membership card that you have to sign up for. $5). Cardgate sorted out, we couldn't get the tv to work correctly. Some channels weren't listed, sound didn't work. A literal third of the tv screen was for the Top Golf logo, incase you forgot where you were at any given moment. I was ignoring the tv anyway, because I came to Top Golf, but a few of the group wanted to see the Sixers game. It never came to fruition.

Issue #2A was with the scoring. The balls have microchips in them, so they know where they go and dole out points appropriately. Except when they don't. Multiple times someone would sink a shot, only to have the ball register a 0. Again, it wasn't like it was the Olympics, so I didn't care about the score, but it did kinda dampen the competitive vibe.

Issue #4 is more of a Top Golf issue, as in one THEY should be concerned about. All the food choices are messy ass finger foods. Now, that's to be expected in a bar/driving range mashup, but are they not concerned with greasy grips or just gunk and food laden clubs? I had a burger that had an over easy egg on it. I was COVERED in yolk by the time it was my turn to whack balls. I had to run to the bathroom and scrub down, but I could EASILY see some teenage slob just grab the club and let er rip, thereby covering the clubs in schmaltz for the next guy. Maybe they routinely wipe the clubs down or something. Eh. 

As far as gameplay, it was fun, but staggeringly easy. I'm not a terrible golfer, but I'm also not a chimp with a stick, so it was barely a challenge to hit a target. I'm SURE its designed this way so that all skill levels can play, but it was actually hard to NOT hit some target. It got to a point where I didn't even aim, I just tried to hit it as far as I could, knowing that it was most likely going in anyway. We even played a chipping game where you had to aim, but again, the targets are so big if you get it in the right DIRECTION, you're most likely going to score. So, its definitely more for an ""all-play,"" family, goof of time, than actual skill or practice. I'm sure there is some game mode that is actually pretty hard though, I just didn't experience it last night. 

Overall though, it was fun, and I'm sure I'll be back. I am a member now, after all. This would be a really good date spot, fellas.....",2018-10-30 21:17:44

As for the food, it was hit or miss. The beef rib was tender, melt-in-your-mouth amazing (although very fatty). The short ribs were decent, I've had better and I've had worse. I was a little disappointed by the selection of sauces though. Because the meats are smoked, you add your own sauce, but there was only 1 sweet, 1 spicy (this one had a weird aftertaste), and vinegar available as options. I definitely expected a few more sauces. 

For sides, I also sampled the mac and cheese (deliciously creamy), sweet potato (forgettable), collard greens (just okay - wish they cut the pieces smaller). The burnt end beans were good, but overly salty. 

I will say it's a cool atmosphere, especially the outdoor patio area, and in a good location right next to Frankford Hall. 

I do also want to mention that I could not believe how expensive my meal was for the amount of food I ordered. I got one large portion of the burnt end baked beans, one beef rib, and two of the regular ribs... and the total came out to $27. I was shocked. Definitely be prepared to drop some $$$.",2018-06-25 02:26:35

The yuca fries were good and I suggest the aioli but I was not a fan of the egg rolls. The tacos were also very skimpy on the filling and the taste just wasn't there for anyone in our group. Also I thought the drinks were pricey for what they were. I paid $8 and didn't think it tasted all that great.

As soon as I walked in, it was a very nice quiet place with an interesting menu. The restaurant had a great ambiance. Reserved a table for 4 on a friday night at 8:30 and were seated immediately. The problem was that we were placed in the corner and none of the staff I guess really saw us. Had a glass of wine and were waiting to order. When our waiter finally got to us it was already 20 mins into our night. He tells us the specials and one of us decided to order the pork chop special. About 10 minutes later he comes back to tell us that the pork chop has been changed to veal. So my friend asked for the menu again (ultimately he decides to go along with it). It takes him another 15 mins to bring out bread. And another 20 to get out the appetizers. And around another 30 minutes for the entrees.

Food: 3/5
Calamari Stufato- Found it to be drowned in sauce, barely any calamari, didn't notice a single golden raisin in it
Roasted shrimp- Came with 3 large prawns which were great, the oyster mushroom was I little overcooked

Capesante: The cauliflower was cold, and the scallops were inconsistent. I found 2 of the scallops burnt and did not bother mentioning to the restaurant considering it would be another 30 minute wait. The others had a nice color to them but as soon as you bite into them, you can tell that the scallops had been sitting in the window for quite some time.

The food definitely could have been better, tiny portions were given, and not enough balance in their dishes.

Service:  2/5
I thought the service was abysmal and I wanted to not leave a tip but I caved and still gave the restaurant more than they deserved. 

Atmosphere: 5/5
Great lighting, love the decorations and how everything is set in the restaurant. 

I was really looking forward to Branzino since I have heard great things but they definitely fell far from expectations. Would I dine here again? Probably not, and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The atmosphere can only get you so far.

I inquired and they said they had overbooked and didn't have a table for us now. Meanwhile we weren't the only table waiting to be seated and were squished in the entry way, dodging all the takeout customers picking up. By 7:40, I went up to check again. They said another minute and it would be ready. I proceeded to ask what the point was for having a reservation if we had to wait 40 minutes. Time I'll never get back. We were fuming at this point! 

Once seated, we were offered appetizers on the house which was a great gesture because our night was off to a terrible start here. We opted for the calamari and the tasting board. The calamari seemed previously frozen and fried really quick and the portion was small. Wouldn't order that again. The tasting board was delicious with a nice mix of cheeses, spreads and toppings. The bread they bring to the table is really delicious. 

Main orders for our table included: the fish special of the night, mahi mahi with mashed potatoes and asparagus, the chicken parm, lemon and pepper linguine, and the Torino sandwich with fries. 

The fish was good but I didn't like the mashed potatoes as they were really bland. The asparagus was way too thick. The fish portion was a bit small and I didn't like the dark meat on the fish. The lemon and pepper linguine was very good and flavorful. The chicken parm was also good but we've had better. The sandwich was enjoyed. 

We got tiramisu for dessert which was pretty good. Overall, the food was decent. I've had better Italian but everyone mostly enjoyed what they got. We had a great waitress. However, we ate so late due to having to wait over 40 mins for our table. It definitely but a damper on our night and a bad impression on our entire party as this was our first time here.

Because the manager proactively came to me during dinner and promised to ""make it right"", which he did with the bill, I'm still giving it 4 stars. 

My wife and I came here after a matinee show at the theater and this was also a slightly early Valentine's celebration since our visit was the weekend before Valentines. Everything started off wonderful and our waiter even gave my wife a gluten free menu once we told him she was GF. We also asked for his recommendation on drinks and he recommended the Berries & Bubbles cocktail. I would highly recommend this cocktail-great drink and a fantastic presentation! My wife ordered the Crisp Wedge of Iceberg as an appetizer, which came out pretty quickly and was delicious! Then it started to go downhill....

About 45 minutes or so go by and we noticed that we still hadn't received our entrees yet people around us who were seated after us were starting to get theirs. Then a food runner comes out to us to deliver us a second Crisp Wedge of Iceberg salad. We were like, thanks, but we've already had ours. At that point, I thought oh boy, I bet they haven't even started our entrees yet. It was close to another 30 mins before our steaks came out and my side but not hers. My filet was to have the Maytag Blue Cheese Crust, which is clearly did not. So back to the kitchen it went and I was just left with my side of Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. As I didn't want it to get cold, I proceeded to eat that. Unfortunately, I finished my side before my filet came back and my wife's side never came out until AFTER she finished her steak. While the food was excellent, we would have liked to have eaten our entrees together along with our sides. This was around the point the manager came over and apologized and offered to ""make it right"". We both ordered dessert. I had the Baked Alaska, which was HUGE but good. My wife just had sorbet, which was also a very large portion.

I had my first experience with Triumph Grill on NYE at 6:30 pm for dinner. I had a reservation and my bf and I were seated quickly upon arriving. The place wasn't busy at all, yet in the dining area where we were seated there were three other tables of diners, and only one waitress. She was stretched but was definitely eager in helping the other tables ahead of ours. We waited for some time to be greeted, but she did stop while passing by to say that she would be right with us. After a while longer, she came back and took our drink orders. After having received our drinks for a few minutes, she passed our table and asked ""how is everything?"" That's strange in that ""everything"" was literally just cocktails. We understood that she was wrapping things up with two of the other tables (giving checks and such) so we let it go. 

After a while longer, she came back to take our food orders. I ordered the cajun shrimp pasta and the boo ordered a sirloin with NO ONIONS. She wrote it down and rushed off. A different staff member brought our dishes, and what was there sitting on top of the boo's steak? FRIED ONIONS. We weren't impressed at all. After a few minutes, our waitress came back with an almost exact replica of his steak, saying ""you were brought the wrong steak. this is your steak,"" and swapped it out. Mind you, THE ONIONS WERE STILL THERE! He stopped her and expressed his concern about the steak. She INTERRUPTED him saying ""that's just for decoration, there are other onions that weren't put on your steak."" WTF?! No apology, blaming decoration, and interrupting with an irritated tone of voice. No bueno.

After she ran off, the table of two sitting close to us asked us if our food was cold? We replied that it wasn't cold. They told us that their soups and entrees were served to them cold. I explained that we were not impressed with our service so far, and they stated that they've had good experiences here in the past which is why they decided to come here for NYE but that their experience this evening was awful. When the waitress returned to their table, I heard the women complain about the temperature of their food. The waitress INTERRUPTED them saying ""we have a cold kitchen. We don't have a hot kitchen."" ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?! Like really?! I've never heard of a restaurant give that excuse for why the food is coming out cold! Never. Ever.

Although my pasta was good, I've received the same quality for about $8-$10 less elsewhere. The boo thought his steak was okay and finished it. I should also mention that I had the Paris Manhattan cocktail, and it was good. Our bill for two entrees and two cocktails came to $77. I inquired if the two chocolate desserts (cake and flourless torte) came with ice cream, and was told ""i can add ice cream for an additional charge."" I passed. I wasn't in the mood to be served by that woman any longer that night, or to give this restaurant any more of my time or money for the evening, so we left, somewhat disatissfied and turned off. 

Based on this experience, I probably won't return here, as it was nothing really to write home about. Cool ambiance (dim lighting), cool motorcycle museums (from looking through closed glass doors), interesting selection of music although a bit out of place with the atmosphere of the restaurant (""Baby Got Back"" was played among other random assortment of 80s/90s pop and hip-hop music), but not enough to overcome average/decent food and terrible service.",2018-01-02 17:16:06

I'm an evolving carnivore.  Non-meat options are gradually finding their way into my diet.  I've always enjoyed fruits and vegetables but, meat has always been a staple.

 I've heard mainly positive remarks and the promise of a Sunny Sunday prompted this suburbanite to venture into the city. HipCityVeg is a small store within a minute walk from Rittenhouse Square.

I was immediately greeted by a cheerful 20 something that eagerly described some of the customer favorites.  She recommended the $9.00 Udon Noodle Salad (Chinese black bean dressing, sprouts, arugula, carrots, cabbage, daikon, peanuts, & spicy glazed ""chick'n"").  My eyes transfixed to an oddly written drink - The $4.50 Groothie (green smoothie with organic apples, organic leafy greens, bananas, & seasonal fruit).  I ordered same.

The Udon Noodle Salad was very good but, was suspicious of the so-called chick'n.  Why?  It tasted like grilled chicken but, in fact, is soy and organic grains cooked on a hot stove.  The Groothie was refreshing and flavorful.  

I won't wait for another Sunny Sunday to enjoy HipCityVeg.",2013-05-11 21:42:10

We got an entire pitcher of coffee to ourselves, our food came out pretty fast, the food was pretty darn cheap. 

And it breaks my heart to say this, because I hyped Sulimay's up so much to myself, and they really seem like sweet people who work here and made us feel right at home, but I just wasn't crazy about the food. I can scarf down an entire plate of eggs, homefries and toast no problem even if I end up feeling sick after (i love love LOVE breakfast food), but I just couldn't even eat half of it. The eggs were spongy, the feta in my omelette tasted off, and the potatoes were nothing to write home about and were on the cold side.

My Mom loves to order from here when she's down in the Reading Terminal Market.  In fact I think she might order from here every time she's in the neighborhood.  We were down in the city for the Philadelphia Flower Show, and no show is complete without a trip to the Reading Terminal Market.  We had some lunch at a different destination and then decided to get some to go from the Little Thai Market.

It's a small shop in the center somewhat typically with a long line as mentioned.  Here's my ten cents:

Salmon Curry - Tons of Salmon.  You definitely get a very large portion for $6.50.  As mentioned in other reviews it is heated up in the microwave, not the worst thing in the world but not great when I want fresh.  To their credit it is very fresh just in a reheated kind of way.  The curry sauce is thin and I wanted more of it to really give a punch of flavor.  The broccoli is totally crisp and fresh.

Chicken with Basil - Again, thin sauce and not as flavorful as I would like.  You get a ton of chicken and veggies over rice and its yummy.  

Chicken Coconut Soup - Now this is what I would come here for!  The chicken is plentiful with veggies and some mushrooms and then ladled over the protein and veggies comes the coconut broth with great depth of flavor.  Now this is  the soup dejour.

I would come back for the soup every time and the other dishes are okay, just don't have enough Thai kick for me.

Lots of fine dishes, with constant rotation of menu.  Some basic variations keep repeating due to popularity, such as poutine (Montreal-style frites/fries with gravy/sauce and curds/cheese).  

 As noted by others, portions are modest and prices are above average....but reasonable considering the creativity and focus on using fresh, seasonal, local-origin ingredients.   The choices of beers/wines also invite experimentation.   Dining space is limited, as is the  parking, but since seating is also limited, there is less competition for parking.",2011-11-01 09:57:51

There are three vegetarian options:  a couple of pastas and an eggplant dish.  I got the eggplant.  It isn't exactly what I'd call ""eggplant parmagiana"" -- it's more akin to a stuffed eggplant, stuffed with ricotta cheese.  It was okay.  The eggplant wasn't crispy, as I would have imagined, and there wasn't sufficent sauce to balance the richness of the ricotta.  I would not order it again, despite that it came highly, highly recommended by one of the wait-staff, who proclaimed that the eggplant was the best dish on the menu, meat or vegetarian.  (If that's true, there is a problem).  The simple side of pasta that came with the eggplant, however, was quite nice.

The garlic bread that came with the meal was meh-ish.  The house salad, also simple, was good and not over-dressed.

Service was outstanding.  I came on the later-side, and opted to sit in the lounge area instead of the dining room.  Both are very nice; the lounge is a bit more casual.  The server did an outstanding job of tending to all patrons, maintaining a fantastically positive attitude overall, and being just plain friendly.

I'd go back (in theory), but if I did, I wouldn't get the same thing.  I get the sense that Reno is not a culinary town, and so decent places may be lauded as brilliant when compared to the local competition.  Back in the Bay Area, I wouldn't give this place a second look.",2011-07-18 09:07:35

We heard about this place and decided to give it a try. We ordered out on a Sunday around 8:15pm. An order of bourbon chicken combo, general Tso combo and an 8 piece order of crab rangoon. They told us it would be 15 minutes and we arrived about ten minutes after ordering and it was ready. 

I had never been in the area before, it looks a little rundown. The restaurant didn't have any customers in it when I entered to get the to go order. They have a LOT of handwritten signs that tell the different rules of the restaurant that doesn't make it feel very welcoming. The total for our meal was $21.33. We came home and busted it open. The bourbon chicken is a non breaded chicken, it had somewhat of a sweet/spicy sauce on it. It didn't taste like bourbon. The chicken was good though. The general Tso's had a LOT of sauce on it. The chicken in the bottom was covered, soaking in it. Maybe next time we will ask for the sauce on the side. 

The crab rangoon wasn't good. It was hard to bite into the wonton and the filling tasted like runny cream cheese. I wouldn't recommend getting them. The peas in the rice were a little on the firm side. I think that must be a Chinese restaurant issue around here though.",2015-08-12 02:33:44

We were in the area & found this place on Yelp! because of the great reviews. You enter the market & make your way to the right of the store. That is where you'll find a little alcove with the restaurant. The hostess stand is the same as the register area, so if there's someone being rung up, just wait behind them to be seated.

The dining area isn't that big, I'd say they have about 14 tables maybe. The menu is very straight forward, even if you're not familiar with the cuisine. Each item has an actual picture, not a stock photo from some website. They've also got pictures of the entrees on the wall around the restaurant. Whoever did the photos did a good job too, they're great. They've also got letters & numbers to go with each item if you're not too sure of the pronunciation & don't wanna look like a fool lol. 

We ordered an order of spring rolls & crab wontons. It didn't take but 5 minutes for us to get them. The spring rolls were good, had a lot of fennel flavor in them. They had shrimp & pork and paired with peanut sauce. I think they were probably pre-made and refrigerated because they were quite chilled. The crab wontons were hot and full of cream cheese and crab, I really enjoyed them and the sweat and sour sauce. The sweet and sour sauce has some heat to it, which I liked.   

I've got a bad habit of ordering pad Thai at a new place, I'm not sure if its because I'm trying to be safe or maybe because it's how I compare it to other places. Maybe both. My boyfriend and I decided that we'd each get a different dish and then split them so we could try each others. We got the pad Thai with chicken ($6.50) and we were going to order the Dry Sukiyaki (stir fry vermicelli noodle w/ Napa cabbage, celery, eggs, shrimp, beef, cilantro, green onions and house sauce $7.50) but our server said that we shouldn't get it. Well he didn't say that we shouldn't get it but he said that it was an acquired taste and if we hadn't had it before then we probably shouldn't order it. I like when servers give feedback about dishes, but I don't like when you feel like you cannot make a selection because the server thinks you won't like it. We ordered the pad Malaysian, as a suggestion from our server. 

I wonder if it has to do with the message at the bottom on the menu that says ""Also know your entree before ordering and will not be refunded after it is placed. Please communicate with your server."" Next time I will order the dry sukiyaki. Our food didn't take but about 15 minutes for it to arrive to the table. Both dishes looked great and I was looking forward to trying both.

The pad thai was good, it tasted like a lot that I've had around town before. Our server didn't ask how hot I wanted it, so I take it that it was cooked normal, probably without much heat. The noodles weren't gummy which is good. It had a LOT of onions on it, I'd probably prefer a little less onion. On the pad Malaysian (stir fry flat thick rice noodle in spicy house sauce, eggs, Chinese sausages, spouts, w/ choice of chicken, beef or pork, $8) I really enjoyed the noodles and the little sausage pieces in it. The sausage reminded me of breakfast sausage. If I had to chose between the two, I'd pick the pad Malaysian.

Overall I was really impressed with the little restaurants food. The unassuming location has a real gem inside. The staff working here is friendly and attentive. FYI they keep the checks up front so when you're ready to leave just head up to the cashier.",2015-04-28 02:34:54

To his credit, he did substantially reduce the tab - but it was not about the money. The good feeling of the evening was ruined and we didn't even feel like eating by the time the food arrived. I don't know why it took so long to cook scallops and the fish special, but this type of delay has happened to me several times.

Don't get me wrong - I have had several very good experiences with both the food and service. However the success rate seems to be running at 50% for me.

7 o'clock reservation on a Thursday night, because neither of us felt like cooking.  So we find ourselves promptly and politely seated immediately.  Nice break from the weekday grind.  Our appetizers and salad courses came quick.  In fact, my salad came so quick, I asked the waiter to bring it back in 5 minutes while we finished our apps.  So finish the first two courses by 7:20 pm.  1 hour later, no entrees.  Me and Shari V are catching up and carrying on, but now we are getting hungry.  So I ask the waitress to check on the food.  She says it'll be one minute.  Great.  Who can complain about 60 seconds.  20 minutes later, I ask the waitress to get the manager.  I ask the manager about our entrees.  She explains that they are catering a party upstairs (as if that matters to me) and that our entrees should be out in 15 minutes.  I told them to forget it and bring us the bill.  A restaurant can screw up in all kinds of ways - bad food, rude waitstaff, mix up an order.  But wasting our time is the cardinal sin.  2 hours later, $60 spent, and we left Altamura hungry.  I was bummed.  Shari V was furious.

I convinced Shari V to retry Altamura for pickup.  She was skeptical but agreed if she didn't have anything to do with the process.  I reordered the Spiedini Mozzarella which is like a delicious gourmet cheese stick.  Fired gooey cheese seasoned with capers. Our entrees were the spaghetti & meatballs for Shari V and the King Crab pasta for me.  I thought both pasta dishes were ok, 3/5.  I liked them but didn't love either.  Shari V's spaghetti was bland (she says lacked depth).  The king crab pasta was overcooked big time.  Made for a soggy dish.  

Hard to be objective with Altamura, but I'd give them a 3/5 for food, and a 2/5 for service.  We were so put out with our in-house dining experience.  We will not be repeating.

They don't really care about their customers. I would not order from this place unless you like terrible customer service and dripping greasy pizza.",2017-09-10 12:58:20

The woman that owns this place is terrible!! I called ahead on a friday afternoon,  she answered the phone,  Yes? I asked may I place an order she nonchalantly says,  no I'm actually not opening this weekend Ok and hangs up the phone lol. Me being the curious cat I am,  I call again next sunday. She answers the phone,  Debreaux's, I ask to place an order for the chicken platter, she says, Which part?? I say well what do you have( mind you I don't have a menu) instead of giving a suggestion. She says ""you know what parts!"" lol, I'm actually tickled by her attitude but any normal person would've ended the conversation for that reply. So I say I'll have wings with mac and cheese and greens. This was about 4:40pm. I arrive to her store at 5:30 to give her some time. It's about 6 hungry people waiting. I can tell by their expressions my food is most likely not ready. I approach the extremely high counter and tell her I've called ahead for the wing platter. She's says Ok it'll be a minute, wow it's only been an hour wth! After sitting inside the store with no tv or radio with the hungry crew for twenty mins I decide to wait in my car. At this point I wanted to drive off to any other restaurant on city av but again the curiosity n me says stay. Finally, about 6:45, 7pm!! Smh she comes from behind the counter and shows me my platter inside. I can't lie it looks amazing and the portions are cool. My wings were fried a tad too hard for me. The Mac and cheese was one of the best I've had in philly, very nice flavor. The greens were good also reminded me of my family down south cooking. However, later that night the greens gave me quite a trip to the restroom that night. I also came to the conclusion calling ahead means nothing. I believe she doesn't actually put the order in until u arrive due to prank callers. However, you'll still be waiting another hour or more! entirely too long. The owner is not friendly, no smiles, small talk and it appears she does everything alone, go figure...  

If your still interested, just go and place your order in person and have at least two hours to waste. And please don't expect the service to be good as your meal.

I also must add this place is a little over priced 16, 17 bucks just for four wings and two sides is a little steep. Not incl the bad atmosphere, attitude, sells NO beverages, and extremely long wait. The bare minimum you can do is be kind to people contributing to your business. Positivity goes a long way ;)",2014-07-24 01:31:35

However, the 2nd best Korean restaurant in town and one that is not that far behind is this place. While Sa Ri One focuses just on Korean food, at Matoi, you can get sushi and various other Japanese dishes as well! How do you beat that proposition?? When I went this time, decided to go for a splurge and get both a sushi roll and a curry combo. I got the Matoi Roll, which was really delicious. I love the combination of the fried white fish on the inside and the raw salmon on top of the roll. It made for a fantastic contrast. The curry combo though...My goodness...I was not expecting such a huge portion! A full on katsu chicken with 2 shrimp tempura, a side salad, and a heaping portion of rice. The curry was nice and thick with a really nice kick of heat. I'm telling you, go in really hungry or on an empty stomach because this dish will leave you feeling absolutely stuffed! The chicken and shrimp were fried perfectly, nice and crispy on the outside while staying tender on the inside. The salad they give you is a good way to temper the heat of the curry if you start feeling overwhelmed by it. All in all, I'm glad I came back to this place after such a long time. It was a fantastic meal and reminded me that Sa Ri One best stay on their toes because this place is not far behind :)",2019-11-22 21:08:50

I understand that we are in a Pandemic. I understand that things may be a bit slower due to a mix of takeout orders and drive thru orders. But I think it is inexcusable to have to wait over an hour for your food when everything is pretty much deep fried. What happened to the fast in fast food?? I decided to swing by to try the new Chicken Sandwich that just came out. In terms of the sandwich itself, pretty solid. Chicken had a nice crispy crust. Inside was nice and moist. The addition of fresh jalapeños and the spicy sauce adds a good kick to really wake up your taste buds. 

But while the sandwich was solid, the service left me far from jolly. I truly think the terrible service I experienced that day was a lack of preparation and management. You go in and there was mass confusion as to who ordered what and what orders have been completed. No one was properly expediting orders or calling out what was needed. This combined with a huge backlog of takeout orders was completely sinking the restaurant that day. Word of advice, you really have to get more organized. If fast food is no longer ""fast"" and customers are waiting 45 minutes to an hour for their order, you just missed the point.",2021-05-17 20:41:10

Although this place is known for their ramen, don't pass up the rice bowls. Today, I decided to try out their Karaage Rice Bowl. Those tender prices of Japanese fried chicken, man, they blow all other types of fried chicken nuggets out of the water. Crispy but not greasy and flavorful but not overly salty, they provide such a good textural contrast to the rice it's sitting on. Top it off with some spicy mayo, fresh green onions, and house made pickled cucumbers and daikon radish, this is the perfect combination of flavors and textures. I just wish there was more seating and a shorter line. But you know what they say, if you want good food, follow the place with the longest line.

I grew up eating Hainanese chicken rice, so I am going to be biased of course, and had high expectations going in. 

I am used to Hainanese chicken being poached in stock with ginger and scallions, which would make the chicken flavorful. Cily's boiled chicken tasted pretty bland. The sauces that were provided did compliment the chicken nicely though. I also liked that the chicken was served warm, unlike Penang's. 

The fried chicken, on the other hand was delicious. I would recommend this over the boiled chicken.

As for the chicken rice, it wasn't seasoned and could use more chicken fat. Our set for two also came with two bowls of broth, with generous pieces of radish in it, which I enjoyed.",2020-11-30 02:26:59

The dining room is classy, with white tablecloths, luxurious woodwork, etc.  We were seated promptly for our 7pm reservations.  The service was satisfactory, but nothing special, and not what you'd expect for fine dining in the French Quarter.  

We enjoyed some great wines and complimentary humus appetizers while perusing the menu.  Started with turtle soup, which was very good.  A few of the others had the gumbo, which they described as ""bland"", and in need of hot sauce.  The entrees were hit & miss, as well.  The filet of beef was perfect, but the sides were mediocre, at best.  Same with the catch of the day, fresh grouper.  

I wish I could tell you that the dessert was the high point of the meal, but sadly, not the case.  In fact, we all agreed that the bread pudding was perhaps the worst we'd had.  Very dry and... tough.  Seriously, how could bread pudding be tough?

Well, we went...but our minds remain intact.

SERVICE: Service was slow, but once we got attention, the staff was patient in explaining the pastries.  It would have been very helpful to have prices and labels for the many pastries for decision making purposes.  The café ran out of ice for our Miel Iced Tea ($2), but the staff managed to convince us that we were, in fact, better off without ice because our tea would not get watered down

CROISSANT: We tried the Chocolate & Almond Croissant ($2.75), which was everything a sweet croissant should be.  Flakey and buttery with plenty of filling.  As a bonus, the croissant was enormous and easily shareable (unless you are a butter-holic...in which case, you should get your own).  Had we stuck to the croissants, this would have been a 4 star review

PASTRIES: Unfortunately, we could not resist the adorable pastries and scooped up a key lime square and a small cheesecake.  The key lime square was passable although otherwise unremarkable.  The little dome of cheesecake was adorable, but the crust lacked any distinction and there was a strange layer of gelatin coating on top of the cheesecake.  We concluded that this addition was meant to create a nice shine and uniform texture on top of the cheesecake, but it really subtracted from the texture

And now for the vilest transgression of all...

The MACARONS ($1.25 each) were incredibly stale.  After hearing the unusually low price, I opted to get one of each, but I should have known better.  These were practically inedible.  In fact, the chocolate was about the consistency of chewed gum and we threw it away after a single small nibble.  Robert Bennet must be incredibly disappointed in the low macaron standards of the new owners!  If you go, make sure to check if they were baked fresh that day!  Otherwise, skip the macarons and stick with the croissants!

I ordered the burger which had hickory sauce and onions. Without the hickory sauce the burger would have lacked any flavor what so ever. I think that is why they doused it in sauce. The texture of the patties also threw me off. The fries were nothing special either. All the food here is frozen and NOT fresh.

This place had some entertainment value They had some video poker machines and a few arcade games. However the jukebox only had southern mullet music on it. I am not really that big of a fan of The Doobie brothers, Molly Hatchet, or Ram Jam.

I've tried several different dishes, but my favorite burrito is the barbacoa, which is braised and shredded beef shoulder flavored with fresh garlic, chipotle chili adobo, toasted cumin, fresh oregano, and S&P.

The food was good, but not as flavorful as what I found in L.A.  Still fresher and better than most any fast food place, though, so a good alternative when you want a quick meal.   

After followup visits to several Chipotle's in different cities around the country, I can't help comparing it to the ~10 Qdoba's I've eaten at from FL to NC and the midwest.   The formula is obviously the same, but I've found I prefer Qdoba's flavors.  I know Chipotle's commitment to organic and local ingredients, and their preference for meats raised without antibiotics or hormones.   So I always anticipate Chipotle should wow me with significantly better flavors, but inevitably, I still end up tilting to Qdoba for my preference.  The only thing I can attribute that preference to would be the seasonings they use, both which kind and freshness.   Add in that Qdoba has queso, and it's always been Qdoba for the win.

I'd still choose a Chipotle in a side-by-side choice with any burger joint, so they definitely succeed in that regard.",2011-10-04 09:44:52

The menu is diverse ranging from sushi to Italian to Tex Mex. No one speciality, so i questioned  if like most restaurants that has varied cuisine, would the dishes be average at best? But food was good! Been here twice  once with a large party of 9 and last time with my boyfriend . I would rate food and ambience a 4 but drinks a 3. The lure Does not take reservations unless you are a large party, a party of 9 or more I believe. Their tapas portion sizes are large compared to most tapas restaurants, but I'm not complaining!

The server who brought us our food told us my boyfriend and I ordered the three best things on the menu which were the fig and the pig flatbread, the Kenny and the Kevin small plates. I certainly agreee! My friends ordered some sushi and she said they were ok. I'm pretty particular about sushi so I wouldn't order sushi unless we are at a sushi restaurant. I've ordered the mojito and the margarita and I found them to be ok.  The Buddha was a lil too sweet/ syrupy for me. For  9/10 dollars a pop, they  should be better than average. I can tell that the bartenders aren't mixologist like at some restaurants where they are carefully measuring and pouring to exact amounts to make the perfect cocktail. With such an expanse cocktail menu I expected the drinks to be good.  

 Fig and the pig flatbread =5, amazing! Better than the one i had at On Swan in Hyde park. Perfect balance of sweet and savory. Has become my favorite flatbread combo.
Lava drops= 3.5-- my least favorite thing I've tried. I saw how yelpers were raving about these, but I should have known I wouldn't enjoy them due to cream cheese. I usually always stay clear of sushi with cream cheese. I think that when used, cream cheese is too heavy and overpower the fish and whole entire dish

 Joey meatballs= 4, good huge meatballs.I would prefer for the balls to be a lil smaller so that they  melt in your mouth buttery soft texture, but they were still pretty moist and the sauce was good too.

The Kenny scallops =5. Bronzed n  smoky yet not overcooked scallops on top of a sweet potatoe mash. If you like sweet potatoes you'll love the light cinnamon yet not too sweet taste of the mash.

The Kevin redfish is a 5. Red fish was fresh and blackened well without being too salty. The Gouda grits peppers and black eyed peas come together in a perfect bite. My boyfriend hates bell peppers and he even joked he liked them in this dish.

The pasta dish with mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and olive oil based sauce =4. Light and simple. 

Ordered the gnocchi special with fried shrimp, pine nuts and sundried tomatoes which was a large portion and the gnocchi was good. I felt though, as we continue to finish the dish, the olive oil sauce made the dish too heavy and greasy. Id give it a 4 rating.",2017-05-12 03:55:02

To make a long story short.  2 adults, 3 kids (15, 13, 11) sat at 2 different tables since they were packed.  We ordered only food and had water all around:

  - 2 dozen charbroil oysters (~$32 total, but overcooked & dry, no dipping 
          cheese butter left for bread) [ 1 for ea table ]

I have been to many red robins over the years and always loved it. I'm not sure if the cook was having a bad day or what. 

I ordered the chophouse burger, which I usually get either that or the whiskey river burger. I ordered my burger medium well and added on bacon. It was supposed to be peppered bacon. I get my burger and tasted a piece of the bacon, and it was burnt. As you can see in the photo it was black. The waitress said she would get me a new burger, I just asked could the bacon be brought out. The bacon was regular bacon with a crap load of black pepper on it. I assumed it would be a gourmet peppered bacon. 

So I wait maybe ten minutes for new bacon to put on my burger. As I start eating my burger, there is an overwhelming taste of burnt. I know the burgers are fire grilled but this was too much. I looked on the burger and the outside crust was black all around. I can only imagine what a well done would have tasted like.",2014-07-14 04:09:47

Arrived at 6:30 for an early-ish dinner.  Had reservations but didn't need them, the place was deserted.  (On a side note, *every* other nice restaurant I've been to has confirmed the reservation by email or phone call the day before.. not the Tenderloin Room)  Seated at a table that wouldn't have been my first choice, since it was on the aisle and right inside the front door.  The waiter came and introduced himself, seemed very charming.  However, I was a little disappointed that upon seeing 4 adults clearly dressed up he didn't ask if it was a special occasion (which it was, my birthday).  I paid attention to the next few people seated after us and EVERY single one of them was asked if they were celebrating anything.  I guess we just didn't rate!  We didn't feel right just volunteering the information because then it looks like you're fishing for free dessert.. and I should *not* have to ask at a place like this.
  
Started with the smoked salmon and bacon wrapped tenderloin tips. Delicious, both of them.  The waiter was kind enough to split up the appetizer so we could each try some.

Disappointed with the rest of the menu.  Online they advertise a *crab* stuffed filet.  Upon arriving we found out that it was a shrimp stuffed filet.  We were told that our steaks were served with a twice baked potato and green beans.  Period.  I don't care for green beans, so I asked if there were any other choices.  ""Oh, of course.. we can do spinach or broiled tomato"".  WTF!?  Why can't you just tell me that or put it on your menu?  Apparently you can also get a baked potato (as seen on another diner's plate.. but for some reason you have to know to ask?!  Ridiculous.  

Of the four of us, 3 had the filet and I had the tenderloin.  We all agreed that on the inside the steaks were tender, well cooked and delicious.  However, three of us had charred edges on steaks - like they'd been left too close to the flame on one side.  I don't like scraping burnt bits off of my expensive steak.

Dessert was phenomenal.  Bananas Foster and Cherries Jubilee made tableside and were delicious.  Cheesecake was good, but the raspberry sauce is literally out of a bottle.  Lame.

Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant is cool but the overall experience just can't compare to somewhere like Morton's or Ruth's Chris.  I don't know if it was our age (well below the average for the restaurant, but we're not college kids and were extremely well dressed) or what.. but I just felt like we were doing way too much work between the lack of acknowledging our special occasion and the lack of detail on the menu.

A friend insisted on having a Friday lunch here, so I agreed to meet her, hoping this visit would be better than my last meal here. It wasn't.

We had a table outside so that was a positive start. The house cocktail menu looked imaginative albeit over priced. I ordered a Brass Monkey because it sounded refreshing, but it was far too sweet, not very cold and served in a coupe glass (which I HATE), garnished with a tired looking bit of orange peel. If I had been smart, I'd have gotten a Tanqueray and tonic or a Campari and soda. Hell, even a Lillet would have been a better choice. So the bad drink was poor judgement on my part. 

We both like seafood so we started with the ceviche of the day. It was 2 types of fish, neither one a type we'd ever heard of, and it was a goopy mess. The ceviche had more radishes in it than fish, it was too sour rather than refreshingly citric, the fish tasted alright but was cut sloppily. We both just got tired of all the radishes and other extraneous vegetable chunks dripping their vinegar off our forks as we tried to spear a bit of the fish. It came with tortilla chips, was unattractive and poorly executed on all levels. We didn't finish it. 

The waiter recommended the crab cake so I ordered that. My companion has a lot of neurotic food issues (and to my mind should just plain NOT eat out) so she got a fish dish that came with spaghetti. My crab cake was okay, not exceptional, not awful. It did not taste extremely fresh, but it was not fishy and did not make me sick so score 2 for that. The other diner spent the better part of the meal scraping the sauce off her fish, then scraping the coating off it as well, then picking all the black olives out of her pasta. I don't know if she ate anything other than the bread and some of the spaghetti. She did not comment on her meal other than to complain about level of spice and I know better than to ask how her food is. This woman thinks a sprinkle of Lawry's Seasoned Salt is on the level of consuming 75 Thai bird chiles so I ignore what she has to say the majority of the time.

No one asked if we wanted a second cocktail. I would have gone for one but I was not going to chase after it. I think service that is that indifferent causes a restaurant to lose a lot of revenue. Tipsy diners always order more even if they don't eat it all and thus tend to have a bigger tab.

I passed on dessert, as did she, but had a nice grappa which was the only part of the meal that I can say I enjoyed. No one bothered to ask if we wanted tea or coffee. 

For a very sub par meal with cursory service, we spent close to $100, not including tip. On the plus side, I am now totally convinced I will never eat here again for any reason, even if the meal was free.",2018-06-24 18:23:50

What I got, however?  Oooof.

The stromboli from NY Slice was decently sized--probably about 8"" long--but was shaped more like a calzone (in a crescent, as opposed to the long straight stromboli).  That, I could forgive, but a solid third of my stromboli was utterly inedible; the dough was overdone and charred in places, to the point where I simply couldn't tear the crust with my teeth, much less chew or swallow it.  The filling was mediocre at best--simply pepperoni and cheese, with none of the other decadence that you'd typically get in a calzone or stromboli.  

That half-moon of disappointment cost me $12, with a bag of plain Lays chips and a can of Coke.

One lone bright spot from NY Slice was their cannoli which was not only tasty, but also drew heads.  No less than three separate people asked me, ""Where did you get that cannoli?!"" as I sat, trying desperately to choke down some of my stromboli.  

It's a crowded food truck market in Indy, but I can't recommend NY Slice.  Try Twisted Sicilian or Hot Box instead, if you're craving some Italian flavor.",2018-08-07 19:23:05

Mother nature was in an incredible mood yesterday so my roommate & I decided to head to Katie's for a quick dinner. The front patio was pretty open so we grabbed seats there and I loved all of my surroundings... gorgeous plants and flowers, tables full of happy people, a hilarious situation at the table next to ours involving two year old twin girls who weren't in the mood to sit and eat. It was just so refreshing to see a good mix of people who were just out enjoying the weather! These recent 100 degree temps are for the birds...

Their watermelon cocktail was on special yesterday, so I ordered one and it was the most perfect drink for a summer day. I wasn't too hungry for pizza this time (shame, I know) so I had the fried artichoke salad with mixed baby greens, asparagus, pistachios & goat cheese. I definitely categorize it in the ""OMG"" category... take a look at the photo. Usually when I get salads I'm left hungry and wanting more, but not this time.

There's not one thing about Katie's I don't like, and I can't wait to come back for brunch to get the egg & speck pizza again! So glad to live just a few blocks away.",2011-08-11 16:54:36

Our service was really on point and everyone was so friendly - a definite plus. We had coffee right away and took our time looking through the menu. There's a lot to choose from between the starters, salads, pastas, sandwiches, and the bigger entrees.

We ended up going with the taglioni pasta with wild mushrooms (to share), and were happily surprised when they split it up for us ahead of time. The pasta was okay, but there was so much salt that it was hard to eat (and even left my mouth stinging a little bit.) It would have been great otherwise. The caesar salad I had on the side, however, was wonderful.

I like the environment at the Crossing for lunch so I'll definitely come back to try something else... the tilapia was looking pretty tempting.

I make juice a lot at home, but it takes a long time and I'm usually out of produce (you go through it so fast!) Clean up is also the worst. I love that I can swing by this place and get a heaping cup of juice before I hit the road. They always have a couple you can choose from, but I typically just ask the owners to make me something green. They throw in a bunch of different things and I've never been disappointed. If you want something more specific, I'm sure they'll be happy to oblige. 

I've only tried one thing from the food menu, and that was the raw pad thai... I can promise you that I'll be back for that one. Everything on the menu looks so good and is so unbelievably healthy. The interior of Seedz is pretty cute too, with a clean, quiet feel... I'm sure I'll meet one of my friends for lunch there soon. They also serve wine in the evening which could be fun.

Sure, you're going to pay more than you would most places around, but you're getting fresh, organic products. When I'm on the go, I'm more than happy to do that. So glad to have Seedz in the neighborhood and I hope they have a ton of success so they stay for a while!",2014-03-14 14:26:30

We started with an appetizer, this was a mistake, we had no idea how big the portions were, so... in the future we won't do this. We started with the Thai spring rolls, they were very fresh and very tasty, but their peanut sauce was a bit too sweet for me.  Since I ordered the hibachi dinner, I also got a salad and soup with my meal, I HAD NO IDEA there was going to be so much!  The won ton soup was DELICIOUS, the Salad was good, but there was way too much dressing (One of the reason for not 5 stars), the Hibachi style steak and shrimp was good, but the the steak was over cooked, to the point of being dry and tough.

We walked in, and took a moment to familiarize ourselves with the menu. I asked what was good, and got the standard answer of ""everything"" and then I was told what was popular, such as their Pulled Pork, pulled chicken and their greens.  Taking those things into consideration, I ordered the Pulled pork diner - 2 sides being the cole slaw and potato salad. The husbeast had the Pulled beef with Cole Slaw and french fries and my friend who was joining us had the sausage dinner with 2 sides of their greens. 

Since it wasn't busy, we had the undivided attention, which pretty much included table service and everything. We asked for our sauce on the side, and it was given. There is no .. choice of sauces, it is only Daddy Mack's sauce, which is light, kind of sweet, with no tang. It's good but it's not Spectacular, and they will sell a 32ox bottle to you for $6.99. 

The food was tasty, well the meat was. The Pulled Pork was tender, a bit on the dry side. The beef was flavorful and the smoked sausage was standard Keilbasa. As for the sides.. The fries were hands down the best thing we sampled. The cole slaw and potato salad were institutional - i'm not even kidding.

Right on the water at the start of the Sponge Docks, ShrimpWrecked is a new addition to the area.  I'd just come back from the hospital - yay foot injury, and I was hungry. So we opted to get food here. First issue, parking is confusing. But once we figured it out, it was easy. 

We made our way to the back of the bar area, to sit out side, because it was a lovely day to be outside and nearly sunset, the perfect time to be on the water.  The hostess sat us and we were given menus. Once that was given, our WAIT-ress, came over and asked us for our drink orders, we placed them, and they came over quickly.. I was ready to order my app, but in a quick second she was GONE. 

We waited... we waited... we waited.  In 10 or so minutes she came back and asked if we wanted to place our orders with the preface that there was a 20-30 minute wait in the kitchen. She just wanted us to know. No worries. We placed our order for a soup and salad, an App of the buffalo shrimp, the coconut shrimp and the crawfish platter.   And she was off. 

Around us, I noticed that other people weren't having the wait times we were, or the others in our section. One table was especially techy about the waitress, I'm not sure specifically about what the issue was, but they had the manager come over and I did over hear them talking about how the waitress wasn't around.  Our drinks went empty.  Finally our salad and soup came out. We enjoyed them. 

And we waited some more. The live music was awesome. I'm not sure who was playing on Sunday afternoon, but he was really REALLY good. 

When the food was delivered, it was hot and fresh. The coconut shrim was as good as the other people have claimed. The buffalo shrimp was hot and spicy, there could have been more celery offered with it.  The crawfish were.. interesting, more like fried clams than crawfish, but what do i know? I've never eaten them before. 

We waited again.. I asked for a refill on our drinks from another waitress.. I asked for a box, when I asked for our box, I had to ask for our check AFTER she dropped the box off.

When we stepped in, we found out you put your order in first, before you sit down. Given that they were so busy, and it was an hour before closing, their ordering board said they were out of a few things. That's ok. We could work around that. 

We placed our orders, I got a pulled pork combo, and my husband ordered a ribs combo, both of us would get our meat plus 2 sides for $11 or $13 with cornbread.  Not a bad price really, just a bit over average.  Once our order was placed, we walked into the small seating area and waited.  .. And waited.. And waited. As I mentioned it was packed in the parking lot, and so it was packed inside.  When we sat, they were calling #96, our ticket was #107 so we knew we'd be waiting for a while. 

Time passed slowly, the husband and I chatting quietly, taking a look at the people around us plates, when I noticed one lady had just gotten her hush puppies, she must have had about 10 on her plate. I told her how good they looked and she offered me one. I politely declined, but I really thought that was nice.   

As we were waiting, the woman who took our order came around to several of the waiting orders and told them that they were out of ribs.  She finally came to us and told the husband that they were out of ribs and would he rather a different meat. He chose brisket, he was fine with that.   When it was time to pick up our plate we were doubly surprised! The serving size of the sides were huge (Unless you got the onion rings, you only get 4) and he got Ribs. Apparently they found the last order of them.  This kind of made the lady who was sitting near us upset as she too, had ordered ribs and ended up getting prime rib. She was not a happy camper. 

The food itself was good. There were 3 different sauces offered. One was very sweet, with a hint of Maple. The next one was kind of sweet but much more smoky and the last was smoky with a lot of heat. I liked the smoky one and the Hubby prefers the hot one.  The pulled pork was well smoked and very flavourful, the potato salad had a *special ingredient* that added some zip to it and made it unforgettable. While the fried okra that the husband had was very tasty as was the coleslaw.  

What I was really surprised to see was that you couldn't get either Coke Or Pepsi there, but rather Kodiak soda, I've never heard of this brand but people seemed to like it. They also had unsweetened flavoured teas to try. 

We will certainly try this place again when there isn't a groupon out, and have a better chance of trying everything we really want to.  I guess you can't fault a place for being popular, and having to turn customers away by telling them ""I'm sorry, we've run out of food!""",2014-01-26 04:18:55

The fish entree specials have been very good but maybe underwhelmed a little with subtle flavor compared to much on the table which had very big flavors (including too much pepper on the ground shrimp & noodles).  Everything has been fresh, well cooked, and generally had nice flavor.  Service has been great and the only recommendation I would have for Peche is to serve bread - especially with all these great sauces you really need some great, fresh bread to be paired either with some nice salted butter or to sop up the sauces.

The wine list is medium-sized but well chosen and some great choices by the glass.  Cocktails are nice and there is a huge 3-sided bar in the front that seats about 15 as well as a raw bar in the back by the kitchen that seats probably 6 or 7.

Before our meals, Julia R and I shared the Grbic salad - it was a bed of chopped feta, tomatoes, and lettuce tossed in their house made Greek dressing. Refreshing and delicious. 

Chicken cordon blue and the chicken roulden were our meal choices and they were both great choices. Chicken was tender and all white meat. The skin was perfectly cooked. On the roulden, there was melted feta and spinach stuffing and in the cordon blue creamy cheeses and ham. They were both delicious.

The chicken was meh at best. It reminded me exactly of the chicken at Moe's. Yes, you do get chips with your meal, but you can count them on two hands. It's strange, they give you unlimited salsa, but the chips they have a stranglehold on.

As I walked out of there, I knew what this place reminded me of. A Tex-mex kinda place you'd eat at in an airport in some random city between flights.

Came back here tonight with a fellow former Korean English Teacher and we were determined to have a reunion worthy of our blackoutkorea days (google it). We stopped by the Wine and Spirits conveniently located a block away and picked up the small green bottle that was a staple of many a dinner back in the day. I downplayed it a bit because, I know this isn't the best Korean, and we've obviously had better (lately every time I go to NYC I magically end up in Koreatown before doing anything). Nevertheless, we couldn't help but get super pumped about the vaccums that come down and up at the click of a button. But that's where our excitement dwindled. 

The service was lacking, but, lets be honest, who goes to an Asian restaurant for stellar service? We went with the Bulgogi Set for 2 (around $40, comes with veggie pancake, rice, and tofu soup). Turns out the tofu soup never came (when I asked he said it was a choice of veggie pancake or soup, and I guess he chose for us). The Bulgogi was not that tender or flavorful, and the banchan were tiny and boring (steamed broc, mashed potatoes, and bean sprouts). The veggie pancake was fine, nothing special. The price was reasonable, but more than you'd pay in Chinatown for way better Asian food.

When I get a grilled cheese, it's to indulge in gooeyness and butter and all things that I know I shouldn't eat, but do when I yearn for comfort food.  This grilled cheese had none of what I was looking for.  It didn't have that oozing out of the side, butter all over the bread making it crisp goodness that I like in a grilled cheese.  It felt like everything was portion-controlled, and designed to maximize profit in the kitchen, and not customer satisfaction.

It's been a long time since I've seen a movie in this location, and I don't remember exactly what the old Cobb theater that was here looked like, but it was nothing like this.  What the Villagio folks did here is just beyond comprehension.  The décor is just great. 

To drink, we ordered a bottle of wine.  To eat, we summoned some nachos and a CHICKEN PARM PANINI (see Gigi S's pic).  Damn was it good.  I've eaten a lot of chicken parm from a lot of different places, and this one was up there with the best.  So good, in fact, that their Italian restaurant in Lutz is now on my radar.  If they make a sammich this damn good, I can't imagine what their full menu is like.

Service was good.  Everyone was very friendly.

My only complaints, well more like suggestions... They should have music and info running on the big screen prior to the movie.  You could hear a pin drop in there, which made it odd as all the couples in there were trying to eat and talk without everyone else being in their business.  It was just awkward.

I went with the Pancakes Supreme. 3 pancakes, sausage, bacon, ham and eggs for $9.50. First of all, no one needs 3 damn pancakes, ever. So leaving hungry ain't an option, especially since they're really good. Hands down, best I've had in Pinellas thus far. Bacon is the real deal too. Thick, meaty, center-cut, crunchy and fresh.

I order the mozzarella boccanccini and La Chica got the steak tartar.  Both had excellent presentation (see pics), but neither were ""OMG"" good.  They were just average in taste with the steak tartar being slightly better.  We also summoned some white sangria, which was surprisingly cinnamon-free.  A lot of places like to load up their white sangria with that stuff, and it's just not necessary at all, so props to Timpano for that.  But three SMALL glasses of their white sangria will set you back $28, and then throw in the two appetizers and all of a sudden you're spending nearly $50.  A bit steep for food hovering around average in taste.  And that doesn't even include any entrees! 

We had a party of 22, and I asked several people around the table how their food was, and these were their responses: ""good,"" ""ok,"" or ""had better.""  No one was impressed with anything other than the atmosphere and service.

Sizzling Pepper Steak - This can be a hit or miss. Seasoning is always spot on, but sometimes the meat they give can be very fatty. If you really like peppers and onions, they also give you tons of it. My wife eats the veggies and I eat the meat. :-)

Salt and pepper pork chops - deep fried pork chops in the same seasoning as the wings. What can go wrong?

Beef chow fun w/gravy - Flat noodles in a brown gravy sauce with veggies. So good! I like the gravy one because it isn't as greasy as the normal beef chow fun which is stir fried.

They also have a bar if you want to drink. Not exactly sure how well the prices are for the alcohol (I've never had it before), but if you are in need of a drink, you can get one.

Overall: I keep coming back because they are fast and good. Come here. You won't be dissappointed.",2014-11-13 13:23:45

I sometimes think most people go for the gimmicks - dancers on the weekend, the Greek dance the waitstaff does (plus the occasional drunk customer), and napkin confetti. They're not usually busy during the day from my past experiences, but it still can have a bit of a wait for food.

I used to swing by on certain nights when a friend of mine was dancing, but after she left the area I really didn't have a reason. After the dirty dining shitshow a while back I actively avoided it. I found myself there recently though. 

I had a waitress who was nice, but not especially good. It took a while to get things (including change for a dollar to feed the meter) and she wasn't really good at thinking outside the box with my lunch mate's request. As with all of my previous experiences, my lunch (a salad) was average. Nothing really stood out, but I was hungry and I could put it in my facehole. 

I find it interesting that people always seem to send tourists/out of towers here. I'm not really sure I would consider it ""one of those places"" but maybe it's the superfluous crap that draws them in (or gives people a reason to suggest it).",2015-06-24 20:13:33

I had the $18.90 lobster tail which came with two sides. I chose broccoli and added a side salad for a $2 up-charge. The salad was a little sloppy looking and the dressing was tossed very lazily.

When you enter the restaurant you choose whether you'd like to be seated at a regular table and have items brought to you or you can sit around a communal hibachi table.  Either way, it was $17.95 per adult.  My-- two-year-old was free.  There is a ""no waste"" policy....you'll get charged extra for anything you leave on your plate but you're allowed to take it with you.  

The restaurant itself was pretty nice....it had traditional Japanese decor and was fairly clean.  I like their yellow swirly tables and they had nice restrooms.  Well....the girls room anyhow...I'm not allowed in the boy's room.  

They have tons of items on the menu ranging from cooked foods to sushi to soups and desserts.  Here's a list of what I tried: 

*Edamame- Pods were on the smallish side but they were fresh and bright green.  The pods were perfectly steamed and nicely salted.  I enjoyed these. 

*Crab rangoons- These were the ""purse"" variety where the filling is placed inside the wonton wrapper and the edges are folded up.  The wrapper was very thin and crispy.  The filling was tasty and smooth and savory.  Be sure to get an order of these if you go.  
 
*Chicken in garlic sauce- This menu item should be called ""huge slices of bell pepper and some tiny chunks of chicken"".  The chicken was like what you'd find in a Lean Cuisine...mushy and I wonder what part of the chicken it came from.  The sauce had good flavor, however, and the bell peppers were still nice and crunchy...I like it when they are lightly sauteed like that. 

*Singapore noodles- Probably my favorite thing I ate there.  The noodles were plentiful and well seasoned...with just a hint of curry and chock full of tasty veggies.  I wish I had a bowl of this right now.  

*fruit cup sushi- By far the weirdest concoction I've ever seen at a sushi joint.  It was chopped mangoes and strawberries on a bed of sushi rice wrapped in nori.  I could not stomach eating fruit and seaweed together so I tore it off and the result was much like Thai mango sticky rice.  It was not torturous but I would not order it again.  I really only ordered it out of curiosity.  

*Coconut shrimp- By the menu description I expected the big butterfly type shrimp with hunks of coconut in the batter but they were more asian style...small shrimp with the tails removed then dunked in batter, deep fried, and then smothered in sweet mayo.  I really wish the mayo had been on the side cuz' I hate mayo.  I didn't want to get charged extra so I choked it down.  *shivers* 

*Vanilla ice cream- must have been good because my mini-me devoured it and didn't even offer me a bite.  The fried dough balls were fresh and coated in sugar although tiny in comparison to the kind you usually find at chinese buffets.  

Next time I'd definitely try the hibachi side...I loves me some onion volcanoes.  I think this would be a great value if you were into sushi as well.",2017-05-31 04:48:57

As you can probably see, reviews vary from both the delivery and dine-in standpoint. I will weigh in on both below.

Delivery (Ordered through GrubHub):
I am very impressed with the GrubHub delivery option that Tsuki Sushi has to offer. The pricing as well and the quality of the food is very competitive with other sushi joints across the neighborhood. I challenge you to find a 3 roll special for the price that Tsuki offers that ALSO has a good fish:rice ratio. Delivery is relatively prompt. I have ordered Tuski over 20 times and they have arrived before the estimated GrubHub time by up to half an hour for a great majority of orders. They have only been late once. (Note: I live in the graduate hospital area.) The sushi arrives fresh and is tasty. As other reviewers note, not all of the deliverymen speak English well, but enough to communicate directions and receive your order without any issues. 

Dine In:
My 2 dine-in experiences with Tsuki were also quite good. I went on weekend evenings both days and there were probably 1-2 other tables occupied when I arrived. Note that the restaurant is small, totaling probably fewer than 10 tables overall. The staff is polite and the sushi just as fresh and tasty as the delivery option. The only thing I will say is that do not be surprised that your sushi takes longer than you would expect for an ""empty"" restaurant. It is likely that your dine-in order is queued with all of the take out orders.

Overall, Tsuki Sushi offers quality sushi in the low-mid price range. If you are looking for exceptional cuts of fish or are a sushi connoisseur, you will probably be disappointed. However, if you're the average person looking to satisfy a sushi fix, I highly suggest you try this restaurant.",2016-04-03 11:48:37

How hard is it to cook an unbreaded, well done chicken wing? Apparently for the kitchen staff at the Fairview Heights Hooters, it's an insurmountable task. For the third time in as many visits, they have failed to cook my requested dish of chicken wings the way I requested them to be cooked. One would think that Hooters could manage to cook an order of their SIGNATURE DISH properly, but that would not be the case. Each time I have visited Hooters, I have ordered the same thing--unbreaded well-done wings. Each time the same thing has happened--the first order of wings (after a 20 minute wait) comes out with breading, and then the second time (after sending the first order back because I ordered them naked since I don't like greasy fried breading) after I make the identical order, I receive unbreaded and UNDERCOOKED wings. Each time I waited FORTY MINUTES and left without getting anything to eat. I cannot put into words how incompetent the waitstaff or the kitchen or both has to be in order to screw up the IDENTICAL order TWICE IN A ROW on the same visit and have this happen on THREE SEPARATE VISITS IN A ROW. I have never seen such incompetence at any restaurant IN MY LIFE and for this to happen REPEATEDLY on THREE SEPARATE VISITS is simply beyond the pale. Chicken wings are Hooter's SIGNATURE DISH. If they can do nothing else, they SHOULD be able to manage to cook a batch of unbreaded well-done wings yet they have failed to do this SIX CONSECUTIVE TIMES. It's not a complicated thing and if they can't master something this simple, then they should really close the restaurant and try something they could succeed at doing--such as playing with their lower lips or walking and chewing gum at the same time. I will NEVER go back to Hooters again--I don't know if their wings are good or bad because I've never gotten to eat any of them.

Lox, lite cream cheese, toasted onion bagel, lots of fresh squeezed lemon juice, thin sliced red onion. cYaL8R. All perfect.

The lox are the very best: Cambridge House of SB. The finest smoked salmon on the West Coast. An old family smoking recipe-method from jolly old England. Fit for the Royal Family. Yes true. As you can see we do endorse the lox here. Plus you can grab a package of lox to take home if you like. Why not! Grab a cheese with jalapeño bagel, or any of the greats, multi-grain power, egg, plain, poppy seed, bialy, they have them all, fresh every morning to go as needed. Get there early, they do run out. The cinnamon raisin if a big fave at our table breaking bagels.

Lunch... two giant menu pages of lunch offerings. Sandwiches, paninis, wraps, salads, soups, burgers, yes beer and wine! Good Peet's coffee choices too!

The tables out front and the patio fill up fast, go early no waiting. Otherwise you may have to hang out for a bit.

On the patio, dog friendly is real nice, great for our Little Pup Lionel, he gets to have a breakfast bonus snack at times. They do serve the best water in Carpinteria for our furry friends as needed.

They cater as well! As partially listed above, the bagel choices are the bomb, off the chain, killer bagels. Bagelwiches to boot. If you love bagels you know Jack's.

They do not serve dinner, they close at 3pm. The mini location on Milpas has plenty of bagels as well.

The second sign that this place was bad was when they didn't bother to use the usual plastic bin to bus the tables.  Nope, that would have been far too pedestrian.  Instead, two of the employees (there were many others who were standing around, which will be discussed in sign three) thought it would be far more efficient to carry two or three glasses at a time.   While these two employees are moving at a snail's pace, the shift manager and what appeared to be a cook stood in the cash register area chatting something about Murfreesboro as the shift manager continued to look totally disgusted by our presence.  We were all a bit perplexed as to why the shift manager didn't seem motivated enough to go out and help her staff clean off the numerous dirty tables in the dining room or why she didn't see fit to tell the other employees (who were standing around and talking about some cute boy while watching the other two bus the tables two or three glasses at a time) to get busy and help.

I haven't tried Dan Dan yet but this place to me was decent. Price and portion match and one thing about Han Dynasty that I dislike is how salty the food is. I understand how it's difficult to have something heavily seasoned and spicy without salt but to me, Han Dynasty is super heavy on the salt.

I asked E Mei to lightly salt my dishes and I'm glad I did!

The Dan Dan noodles here are quite spicy. They didn't really ask me about the spice level I wanted for these. The noodles I wasn't a fan of; super thin and definitely not hand made. I won't be ordering these again.

The spicy hot fish hot pot was my favorite. The fish was well seasoned, not big pieces but enough for 2 people. I also enjoyed the amount of bean sprouts that were in the dish but I didn't really care for the glass noodles.

The dry hot pot chicken was also good, little pieces but seasoned and fried very well.  

The mapo tofu was OK, i like my soft tofu to be way more fresh but it was still delicious and i asked them not to make this that spicy which i enjoyed since all of our dishes were very spicy.

Bright interior space and freshly painted walls give a great impression when you first walk in...unfortunatley, that's the last good experience you'll have

The staff is clueless and walking around frantically, but no one knows what anyone is doing.  There were 3 (THREE) hostesses working, all arguing about what table number a party was just seated at and trying to figure out their request to change tables...and too busy to help us immediately.  Once we got their attention,  we asked for a booth, and asked to wait ""about 5 minutes"", until they could figure out the current table problem.  With less than 1/4 of the restaurant and bar area filled, there should have been no delay and no reason ONE of the THREE hostesses couldn't help us.  A few minutes later we were told there were no booths available...and then we were led past 6 open booths to be seated at a 4-top table.  Maybe they were reserved, but we were there for about 90 minutes total and not a single other table was sat meaning that all 6 booths sat empty (plus 1 more from a table that finished and was reset).

Our waitress started off friendly, but was overly chatty, spending more time asking our friends son about school, what he liked, what grade (he's 14, not exactly a young child), favorite subject, etc, etc.  It was like having dinner with my great aunt.  She then spent 3+ minutes going over the Pellagrino flavored selections on the menu and how we are supposed to drink it properly...you'd think it was some crazy new drink we'd never seen before (maybe Downington is that rural that's it's new for them?)

The wine is served in a cheap tumbler like water glass...very European if you're drinking table wine in Rome, but a little low rent when you're drinking a $14 glass of wine.

To finish off our great service, the food came out and each course was served to the wrong person, and right after our apps were served, the same server placed another tables entrees down on our table.

The Calamari was actually good, we were told it was made fresh and the breading was light and not at all oily.  Unfortunatley, the little bit of calamari we found on the plate was heavily overshadowed by the fried yellow pepper rings  (which we initially ate mistaking them for calamari rings!).

Pear salad was good, but not great.  The pears were kind of bland and it was a little light on the cheese, but the overall portion size was good.

Spaghetti and meatballs tasted like store-bought boxed spaghetti with a watery and bland tomato sauce....how do you open an italian place without eing able to make a red sauce???  I shouldn't be seeing chunks of red separating and leaving a bowl of water for the pasta to sit in.  Simple execution aside, there was no flavor at all to it...pretty much a watery and bland red soup the pasta sat in.  The are three large meatballs, but they are under seasoned as well.

Gnocci with braised short rib was a little on the sweet side, served in a brown sauce.  The gnocci tasted fresh made, but the sauce was a little overpowering, although it was one dimensional.

Three of us ordered pasta and we had to ask for a grated cheese.  The large hunk of cheese was grated with a corse grater leaving too large of chunks of cheese on top of our dish.  After maybe a 1/2 tablespoon of cheese, the waitress started commenting on the ""mole hill"" of cheese and how we were using too much of it, etc....I'm sure she was just trying to be funny, but after spending as much time talking to her as we had each other, we were pretty sick of her commentary.

Dessert was served in small glass cups with 4-5 mousse-like options, you basically pick the glass(es) you want, no other options.  If you've eaten at the owners Harvest restaurants, you'll recognize the process.

Initially, this is a really cool space, but the execution is so far off, it's not worth your time.  Maybe after they get the staff properly trained and settled, the service issues will be taken care of, although I'm more concerned with the failures in the kitchen department and highly unlikely to ever return for a second chance",2013-08-19 03:17:32

2. The roti with the chicken curry (2 orders) came out, food was good, but one person in our dining party asked from some sriracha, and the same waiter who was annoyed with our small order rolled his eyes as if the sriracha request was a major imposition, but he brought it over. 

3. When i ordered our food, i asked for the peanut pancake dessert at the time of ordering, because I know it takes a long time. 

4. our waiter disappears after another waiter delivers our entrees , and never came back to our table. 

5. as we were done with our apps and main course, i asked, where our peanut pancake was.  everyone looked confused , and they told me it was never entered on the initial order.

i think it would have added another 7 bucks to the bill...

Then while other customers are walking out our waiter was all of a sudden friendly and cheery to others?

Looks to me that there may be an orchestrated campaign against Sun Ray.

First off, the large parking lot is right across the street, not a block away.
Second, we have never had a disaster meal here.  Worst we have experienced was an almost well-done cheesburger.

Sun Ray is almost always open, has no really greasy food, and has a wide-ranging menu. 

My biggest complaint is that they quit carrying Coors Light beer.  And, some of their best food offerings aren't on the menu.  Just ask.

Place & restrooms are clean.  Waitstaff is stable and friendly.  Owner is frequently there and has been very nice to us.  ""Alexis"", the dinner-time manager is great.

They have nice steaks under $30, full sushi menu, good specials, neat sides, full bar.  Some of their seafood is sorta California-style, but good.

Not a tourist place; most customers live nearby and frequent this eclectic eatery.

I say try Sun Ray, it won't disappoint.

They recently (2018) cut the portions in half and it is not enough food to buy one entree. One entree is around 12 bucks or so. So the cost to eat here just doubled to 20+ just for the food part of the meal.

I just went to eat here for lunch and i ordered a chicken sandwich with fries and an iced tea. (last time i got the fried fish)

the sandwich was good except the amount of chicken was only enough for about 2/3 of the bun.  Very small like something a 75 pound model would eat. you could easily eat the chicken in 2 bites.

The fries were cold and stale as if they had been cooked 2 hours prior, maybe longer. I normally cant avoid fries, but i actually did not eat them.  This is a very rare occurrence and ruined the overall meal.

After the waitress/bartender gave me my food, i had to ask for silverware and a napkin. she looked at me kinda strangely. i had to use the knife to cut off most of the bread out because i didn't order a bread sandwich. 

She then proceeded to disappear for about 30 minutes. (i never actually saw her again or any waitress for that matter). I DID NOT receive one single refill on my iced tea the entire 45 minutes to an hour i was there. my tea sat empty for at least 30 minutes. there was also a piece of hair in my water.

when i was tired of sitting there staring at the table i decided to stand up and wait for my check. after about 20 minutes of waiting for my check i went into the kitchen and asked one of the cooks if they could check me out. i could have walked out and not paid easily.  This is probably the most appealing part of this place. (chance of not having to pay)

i proceeded to leave $0 for a tip, which IS SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER DONE IN MY LIFE. this is officially the first time i wrote $0 on the tip line. i am so happy i did and wish i could have wrote a negative number for how terribly bad this bia was serving me.

i would only recommend this place to a desperate house wife that likes to drink wine and has a lot of money. also, if you have a hipster hair styleand a lot of money you might also like this place. everyone there had a hipster hair style.

Side orders of onion thangs, and loaded french fries are wonderful - but every burger order includes a side of french fries, so I rarely order another side item.

They also offer ice cream, milkshakes, and usually have an assortment of cakes for dessert.

Service is super friendly, and the food comes out surprisingly speedy, which is great because they do not accept phone orders.

Their baked goods, including their unique cronuts, are outstanding, and I highly recommend them.

We came on a Sunday, pre-movie, and since the wait time was only ten minutes for brunch, we decided to wait. I love that they take your cell number so they can text you when you're table is ready.

We were led to a small table in the back, and were greeted very quickly by our upbeat server. It's wonderful that they offer soy milk options, however, my soy latte was probably the worst-looking latte I have ever seen in my life.  No foam, no design, no nothing - and it supposedly was made seconds before she ran it out.   It was lukewarm at best-plus, it took longer than my BF's bloody mary to come out.  Weird.

For my meal I had the Roasted Vegetable Tartine.  It was one piece of challah, with petite diced roasted vegetables on top, Gruyère cheese, and a fried egg.  That was it. No sides, no garnish. So, while the flavor was delicious, I felt it was way too small of a portion for the price.  Thank goodness I planned on eating popcorn at the movie, or I would have had to order another entrée!

My favorite items to order here are steamed dumplings, Singapore style rice noodles, salt and pepper tofu, and chicken noodle soup. But really, everything I've tried is great.

One caveat though - we brought some non-adventurous eaters here, and we could tell they were a bit thrown off/horrified by the dead ducks dangling in the windows, and the fish tanks all along the wall chock full of fresh seafood to eat.

You walk in, and the woman who takes the order was very friendly, polite, and helpful. She handed me their menu brochure, because the display board doesn't show all the offerings. She also gave me suggestions. I love when people offer recommendations when I go to a place for the first time!

I went with her suggestion of the Xtreme Sope, which was a flat tortilla shell topped with pulled pork, black beans, cabbage, pico, sour cream, guacamole, and cheese.  Wow was this awesome!  No matter what else you get - get one of these.  She recommend the pulled pork, and that too was spot on.

I also got two of their tacos to try.  One Xtreme taco with chicken, and one buffalo shrimp taco.  The chicken taco was basic but good, and I loved the buffalo shrimp taco; it was super spicy, but in the best possible way.  The food took about fifteen minutes to prepare - I could see they were preparing a lot of to-go/delivery service orders.

They have a separate dining area if you choose to eat in, which is only a few tables, but it's away from the take out window, so it would be a good option.  They have two sauces, green and red, hot and hotter, available to help yourself. 

The only thing I didn't love was the parking.  When I went in, I was the only customer, yet there was only one oddly angled parking spot available.  When I left, I saw that parking is available along the nearby fence, but it is still not very many spaces.  Plus, getting in and out of their place via Waters Ave can be a tricky situation, as the section is a feeder to I275.

I don't hang out in the area, but had some errands and my friend worked down the street, making it the perfect opportunity to try. It was MLK monday and the place was packed (12:30pm). Luckily the crowd comprised of large groups. The bar is seat yourself, so i scored 2 seats. About 20 minutes later, there were no more seats at the bar. 

I was a bit skeptical of getting in and out in a timely manner considering the kitchen was in the middle of lunch rush. We ordered 2 shortys--i liked my Philly Wheat WIt and my friend liked his Neshaminy Jawn---we kept it real philly! I think the shortys are a good marketing tool (ploy even?). It was a pricey pour ($4-5) considering the size but not a deal breaker--i would go for a pint if you know how a certain beer tastes. Our bartender was nice and efficient.

The menu is diverse and offered a variety of continental dishes, american, southern, asian-inspired, mexican/tex-mex inspired. Again, i was a bit skeptical of the menu delivery good flavors being so large. I ended up with the chicken enchilada stack and my friend got the spicy jambalya (small, with brown rice). 

The food did take awhile, but not that long considering how many diners were in the restaurant. Again, i expected to wait so it wasn't horrible. I will say, the kitchen seemed to push food out fairly well but mostly because the dishes were typical lunch/american stuff like sandwiches and fries---quick orders. 

My friend said his dish was warm, probably waiting under a heat lamp while my dish was being made---my dish was nice and hot. I thought the chicken enchilada was pretty good. The small jambalya only had 1 shrimp which was disappointing. We both finished/cleaned the plate. The portion was not ""diner style"" huge, but not ""high end"" tiny, just in between. 

We both enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The music was on the louder side, which I assume made the crowd speak at a louder volume (including myself), but good vibes all around. Will definitely make an effort to stop by here more for happy hour.

It's a BYOB so that helps a bit on price, but for the amount of food you get, I think it's a little hard to justify the price. Plus, they don't do much to make you feel like you're eating in a truly upscale restaurant. It's a bit bare, with not much on the walls, it's pretty boring actually.

The dark and homey decor throughout, with the fireplace being my favorite set the scene for an English menu filled with lots of classics like tandoori chicken, fish and chips, and bangers and mash, while also throwing in lots of other dishes and plates to try from meat and cheese plates to deviled eggs and foie gras.

He ordered the huarache de vegetal, which was basically a black bean corn cake on top of a lot of stuff (looking such things up on wikipedia)..nopales (from prickly pears), chayote (gourd), and poblano pepper. It was a large amount, probably adding to why we didn't finish our guacamole. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos. They were just enough to fill me up without making me feel huge and I enjoyed the flavors in the remoulade. Too full for dessert and went on day I needed to study a lot so no drinking, though from what I saw, the drinks looked delicious.

Will definitely be back, even if it is just for guacamole and drinks. Groups love coming here. In fact, I think a whole high school class ~20-30 people came. So apparently highly recommended by many. I guess I don't blame them.",2009-05-06 07:38:19

First, let me say...the customer service was stellar. It was young lady who helped us (unfortunately I can't think of her name) and she was awesome. 

Now, on to the food. Maybe we came on an off day but I just think that it was subpar at best. Nothing we ordered came out hot...which can be typical for BBQ but not even the baked beans or corn was hot. The BBQ chicken was also very, very dry. So dry it was obvious just from looking at it. 

In total, we had ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and chicken at the table. The best thing on the table were the ribs. I believe had they been hotter and had the cut of the ribs be a little cleaner I would've enjoyed them more. 

I wouldn't be opposed to trying it again, just on the hope that they were having an off day the day I came.",2016-07-22 15:39:39

It started with having to order at the counter, and no real place to stand if there's a line at the counter. When it was our turn, the order-taker drifted away without acknowledging us, so we were left wondering if/when he would return. I strongly dislike ordering at a counter. It makes me feel like I'm at a McDonalds.
Once we were seated, the next unpleasantness is the NOISE. This little house is all hard surfaces, so it was really loud. 
We ordered Suppli because Calafuria posted a picture and description on their FB page. It's deep-fried tomato risotto with a heart of melted mozzarella. The whole thing was absolutely flavorless, even the cheese. No hint of salt or seasoning anywhere.
Which led to not finding any salt on the table. It's fine if the chef wishes to leave out salt, but at least make it available to diners,without having to ask for it. Salt and pepper should be on every table.
We both had eggplant Parmesan, also lacking in flavor, but slightly better than the suppli. Again, the cheese lacked flavor, and nothing tasted like it had any seasoning. The eggplant did have a nice texture. I asked for some Parmesan which I carefully sprinkled over the dish, and I treasured each little nugget of flavor because it's the first I'd tasted at this meal.
The service was good.
I doubt we'll be back.",2016-05-16 08:53:11

The food and quality was mediocre. Prices were a bit expensive for the portion. 

The beef ribs were good, very flavorful. I would go for more of the uni scallop dish! The uni sushi was okay, could've been better and it was weird that it came with avocado. The otoro sushi was not good, it did not taste like what it's suppose to be. The fried oyster roll was good and interesting. Our sushi bowl (Big bang,$29?) was okay. The fish was good but the rice was too sticky and packed that it was hard to eat. We also ordered the King crab milky ramen ($18). The ramen itself was good but broth was bland..

 The beef was pretty bland and nothing special. 
The pernil (pork) was a little on the saltier side, but complements well with the rice and beans. 

Now, another thing to note is the PRICE! My gluttonous group definitely over-ordered (ended up feeding all 4 of us almost to the point of death, with enough leftovers for 4 extra meals) and each of us paid $18.

Sachiko is pretty full every time I eat here, and I don't usually have to wait for a table. The complimentary miso soup is very hot and is a nice way to start the meal.

Portion sizes were quite large, especially considering the fair meal prices. The building is a new rehab and I'd describe the ambiance as modern, clean, and upscale hipster.

The decor is delightful!- silverware is piled into an old coffee can and there are simple fresh flowers on each table.  

Oh yeah...the FOOD.  The menu is creative and unique.  I love this because I always feel like I could make other brunch places' offerings very easily at home.

I ordered the cornmeal pancake with fruit, cream, & cinnamon sugar- it satisfied my sweet tooth without being overly rich or heavy.  I paired it with the ricotta whey grits- they were perfectly (very simply) seasoned and very creamy.  Personally, I'm glad that Milktooth's portions aren't huge.

However, the one cheese pizza had just come out of the oven, and we each had decided on one of those slices.  The crust was super-thin and crispy with some char, and the cheese was great.  What I didn't like was the sauce.  Dare I say that it almost tasted like restaurant canned sauce from a distributer?  Wasn't that great for me, but it's pizza real late at night, and you really cannot go wrong.

Slice also offers a Yelp check-in special of a can of soda with the purchase of 2 slices or salads.

I've only eaten here twice and both times the service was very bad.  I came back the second time thinking maybe they were having an off day but apparently not.

  Basically my experience went like this: After an afternoon of shooting candids downtown, I walked into a mostly empty restaurant. 3 people in the place, including the server, who upon seeing me... almost immediately walked in back and did not return for about 5 min.

  As I was starting to debate leaving, he came back out and hurried me to a table, handed me a menu and was gone again.  Ok, maybe a bad day?  I let it go, but after about another 5 min and no drink order, I was starting to get frustrated.

  Then something funny happened; a group of 5 people, obviously casino workers, happened into the place and holy crap, this guy came alive.  He rushed out to seat them, making small talk, suggestions on the menu and taking -their- drink order.  Not mine tho, I had to wave him over.  Finally, after these folks got their drink order, he came over to get mine and my lunch order. No small talk or suggestions by the way.

  My food did come out fast, and around the time as the other table and the vermicelli was adequate but forgettable.  Never saw the server again till I paid, where I gave the cashier a $10 tip, left a dime on the table and left.  And I won't be back.",2011-04-25 18:08:16

The best finger food there is(sorry sushi) and have ate at and reviewed just about every place in town that is worth reviewing but every time I get caught up in a conversation about it, people bring this place up as the best. Even to the point of being dismissive of my opinion since I had not.

  I really wanted to knock this one out in 2020 but being an ""essential worker"" has made it hard to do anything this season, but I digress.

  I went here on a Saturday night a couple weeks back and it was lightly seated, with delivery drivers seeming to make most of their business. They have a good selection of hard spirits and beer behind the bar. Limited seating in an already somewhat cozy space.

  I ended up taking to the kitchen manager before I ordered to find out how the wings were cooked.  Mainly because I prefer a fried chicken wing to a baked one.  Its a texture thing.

  They actually par bake the chicken beforehand and finish it in the fryer.  I imagine this is because the wings themselves are very meaty. Like twice the size of a normal buffalo wing.  If you tried to deep fry something big and meaty, you tend to overcook the outside and leave the inside a little rare.

  The result is chicken that has a more roasted texture, rather than crispy fried. Think a rotisserie chicken.  Juicy and flavorful. No, It doesn't have very crispy skin but it's still very good.  It is also served fast, probably less than 7 min.  

  Then there is the toppings, which consisted of peppers, garlic and parm.  Perfectly accented th chicken without overpowering it or making me want to scrape off the detritus before I dipped it in the house made ranch. Which, by the way, is the best ranch I've had.

  So yes, Noble Pie knocks it out of the park with their wings.  Not something I will seek out when I am wanting traditional style but definitely something I will suggest to anyone wanting a nice, juicy and meaty wing.  Of which there are plenty.",2021-01-06 17:20:42

I normally am not a fan of chain restaurant cocktails as they tend to just be full of sugary mixers, but I gave the spicy margarita a try and was pleasantly surprised. I think the strawberry was unnecessary, but it was still a good drink. They have plenty of good local drafts to offer. 

Our server Lance was very nice and funny! I was unsure what to order because most of the options seemed underwhelming (standard sports bar fare though). I settled on the Nacho Mama's pizza, and I'm glad I did! It also would make a yummy cold midnight snack with the leftovers! That pizza has refried beans in lieu of sauce, cheese, jalapenos, and a sour cream drizzle. It's like nachos on a pizza! It was very good! The crust was soft but also had a nice crust on the outside. I definitely recommend eating it with a fork as the bottom crust doesn't really stay firm under all those toppings. 

My husband had the boneless wings and said they were better than BW3's. I haven't been impressed with B-dubs lately so take that for what it's worth. They definitely looked good although I didn't try them - the chicken was tender and didn't look processed much. 

There are plenty of TVs around to watch whatever sports are in season. The garage bar is completely separated from the rest of the establishment, but it's a nice feature I think.

That's right, I'm calling you out.  In a review about a business that I think you've been treating unfairly.  I notice that ABP has gotten abysmal ratings, and I think that it's a little undeserved.  You can't give them one star because you wish you could order off of the McD's dollar menu instead of getting a pastry.  That's a gripe about Vanderbilt's decision to put in ABP and take out McDonald's, and does not belong in a review of the restaurant.  ::end soapbox::

ABP is a nice, newly renovated space that serves some tasty food.  Yes, their sandwiches can be a little pricey, but I think that they are more unique than say, a Subway sandwich, and I've so far been impressed with their freshness and quality.  If you want a Subway sandwich, there's a Subway within a five minute walk.  In two different directions.  They've got a variety of healthy and not-so-healthy snacks, a nice coffee-bar, including espresso beverages, and I really enjoy that they provide the nutritional information so that you can make an informed decision about what you're purchasing.

My husband and I have become fans of Sahm's n Sahm's endeavors (i.e. Big Lug) for their consistent quality of food across the board at each locations. 
We have made this location a regular spot due to its location close to my husband's workplace. He loves the Sirloin steak that comes on a sizzling iron plate. Never strays. I seem to have found my favorite with the Bistro Burger. I can't quite remember the name of another sandwich I had, it was a special of the day but know I was very happy with it.
I am not one of those reviewers who has the ability to paint a picture of tastes with words. What I can do is share that this food will make you smile. Read the menu, does something sound interesting? combining flavors and items that intrigue you? Then order it, you won't be disappointed! Feel free to order how you want it. This is no chain where shit comes pre mixed or frozen all together so they just heat it up to serve.
This location is mainly a bar (they do allow kids) with a stage as they frequently have bands. No frills. Service is good, lots of selection for beers, and drinks are strong.

The tatziki sauce was not over powering garlicky or cucumbery  (trademark pending on that word). I would prefer regular fries with a squeeze of lemon ad greek seasoning as opposed to the coated fries they serve. I really liked the baba gnoush (sp?) even though it was on the smoker side.

What I like the most about Julio's is the open atmosphere when the front windows are open. In the summer it is one of the busiest patios, but it is worth the wait! If you can, definitely make a reservation because this is a happening spot every night of the week in the summer. It's a great place to enjoy some drinks, Mexican grub, with in your face views of Whyte ave and some great people watching! Oh, and complementary chips and salsa when you're seated - how can you resist! The decor here is also great and it has an awesome vibe. Every server I've had has been funny and attentive. 

The bar here is AMAZING. If you want to have drinks on Whyte, come here! They have excellent margaritas, beers, and liquors. My personal favorite is the bulldog, a margarita with a corona in it! I'm kind of getting thirsty for one right now... 

The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because the food, while good, isn't anything out of the ordinary, but it's definitely still good.

A few quick notes, Angelo's is cash only, but they do have an ATM inside. When I went on a Friday afternoon, the place was absolutely packed; they did manage to get our food out to us quickly. A few tables outside the store, and some standing room inside the store to eat, but expect it to be jammed. The girl taking our orders was very friendly, and helpful, recommending I get Cooper Sharp, over American Cheese, which turned out to be the right suggestion. 

The cheesesteak with onions and Cooper Sharp cheese is the way to go. Let's start with the surprising star of the cheesesteak, the bread. We're talking about an Italian roll freshly baked in-house. It's seeded, fresh, and used perfectly. Probably the most overlooked element to any cheesesteak, Angelo's nails it. You get this perfect crunch with every bite, and I cannot even begin to tell you how good a fresh baked Italian roll is. To talk about the cheese, go with the Cooper Sharp. It's basically a sharper American, and having tasted them both side by side, the Cooper Sharp adds the perfect balance of flavor. The steak it good quality, cut into ribbons, but not really chopped up too much. I will say, the only real knock on the cheesesteak is I wish there was a tiny more steak on the sandwich, as I did get a few bites with just bread (not that I'm complaining, but is wonderful). The meat is very tasty, and more ribboned, not chopped finely. Also, when you get onions here, you can taste them. Not finely chopped, so you really get the crunch of the onion. In terms of competitors, I think John's Roast Pork cheesesteak is close to it, but the fresh Italian roll, and Cooper Sharp cheese puts this over the edge.

I also had cheese fries while I was here, honestly, they were whatever. Just average, out of a bag fries with some cheese wiz on them. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it's a classic, but nothing special about the cheese fries. Price is $11 for a cheesesteak, which I think is a bit on the higher end for Philly cheesesteaks, but totally worth it.

Okay, so I was here with my dad on a Friday for lunch. We got here at about 1 and we were seated immediately- great! I was here for the restaurant week lunch special, but I think they might do the $20/3 course special all the time, I'm not sure.

For my three courses I decided on the thin cut fried pickles, the shrimp and grits and the bread pudding. The thin cut fried pickles were great! Lightly battered and not heavy or overly filling. This was a great starter. The shrimp and grits were okay. The grits were decent, but not the best I have ever had and on the somewhat bland side. The shrimp are tail-on, but they were cooked nicely and were a good size and juicy.

My main reason for the 3 stars is the fact that they were out of bread pudding and we weren't informed until the end of our meal. The reason we decided to even have lunch here was because we wanted the bread pudding. Honestly, I feel like they should have either put two bread puddings aside at the beginning of the meal when we ordered, or they should have come out and said that they were out of bread pudding. I just felt like I had been kind of tricked and I don't like that feeling. And how do you run out of bread pudding two hours into lunch? Instead of bread pudding we were given chocolate torte and it was okay, but I wasn't in the mood for chocolate at all.

Anyway, the owner was super sweet and the service was good. I just don't know if I'll be back or not.",2016-09-18 22:20:04

The line moved quickly and when it was my turn to order I got the crawgator, which is alligator and crawfish sausage with cheddar and pepperjack cheese, onions and peppers. I don't think I had ever had this sandwich before and it was SO GOOD! If it's your first time and you are looking for something really cheesy, I would go with this one. It's all packed between two buttery slices of sour dough bread and it's just perfect. For my side I got the bacon mac and cheese, which was beyond rich and delicious. I was happy they had ""to go"" boxes, because there was no way I could have finished all of this in one sitting.

Walking in, the restaurant is small but nice. We were here during the week, so there was no huge crowd and there were a few empty tables. We sat down and the waitress was quick to come over, bring us a bread basket and take our beverage order.

Looking over the menu, everything sounded delicious. I decided to go with the Penne Alla Vodka which is penne pasta, mixed with a delicious cream sauce and huge pieces of crab. It was delicious and creamy and I was delighted that there was plenty of crab. The dish had a lot of flavor and wasn't overly filling.

My only complaint was that service was pretty slow.  Considering it was a week night and there weren't a lot of people in the place, it took a while to get our food. We weren't in a rush, but from the time we sat down until the time we left, two hours had passed. It took about 45 minutes to get our entrees, even though we didn't order anything crazy complicated.

Not that Station 6 doesn't have meat, but a good rule of thumb is stick to what the place specializes in.

We were here a little after the lunch rush and were seated inside immediately. They also have lovely outdoor seating, but it was fairly warm on this day, so I chose to sit in the a.c. Looking over the menu, everything looked incredible. I had heard raves about quite a few dishes here, and I decided to go with the trout almondine.

The trout was perfectly prepared and was topped with a nice butter sauce. It also came with a side of new potatoes and asparagus, which I only ever enjoy in restaurants, so I consider that a treat. My photo doesn't do this dish justice at all: the fish was tender, juicy and full of flavor. The potatoes and asparagus were nice and buttery and all of the flavors of the food blended together wonderfully. The portion was light and great for lunch.

My one complaint is the wait time for the food. Usually when I go to a restaurant for lunch I expected to be in and out within about 45 minutes, max. Well, from the time we ordered to the time the food hit the table, 30 minutes had passed. I guess that one could argue it's because the meal was made-to-order and it takes time, but with only a few other people eating I was kind of baffled why it took so long.

Gallier's gumbo is big on flavor with smokey undertones; and the serving size was big for $11.  It was probably about a 12/14 ounce bowl.  It's a dark, very thin roux, which isn't bad, but definitely a bit more soupy texture.  There was plenty of sausage and chicken in every spoonful.  We ordered our gumbo New Orleans style, which is with potato salad (on the side) for an extra $2 each.  I was skeptical about gumbo and potato salad but some of my employees had previously encouraged me to try it--I must say that the combination was magical.  The potato salad was southern, a bit sweeter but offered a great balance with the savory gumbo.  Served with buttery garlic bread.

We also tried the chargrilled oysters, $13 for half dozen.  Heavy on the cheese compared to other restaurants, like a sharp cheddar vs. mild Parmesan.  Not ideal for me, so I'd pass next time and stick with only the gumbo.

The shashimi was dressed with black and white sesame seeds, wasabi swooshes, and a seaweed salad.  All good.

For entrees, we had the fish and chips, the fish sandwich, and the crab cake sandwich.   The crab cake was all crab but could have used a bit more seasoning and a smaller bun..

I ordered online and opted to pick up in the drive thru. There were three cars ahead of me when I arrived. It seemed to be taking a very long time for those ahead of me to receive their orders. When I pulled up to the window, the employee did not realize my order was the one placed online. She promptly gave me my drink, but then I waited longer for my food. Honestly she seemed quite overwhelmed. I must have waited 25 minutes from the time I arrived until receiving my food.
As I drove away, I double checked my order and was missing the Mexican Pizza. I was not going to wait in the ever growing drive thru line again, so I decided to go inside. There were a few people inside that seemed to be waiting for their food and were beginning to get agitated. The cashier working that day had no sense of urgency and was not rude, but not pleasant either. I explained that I was missing the Mexican Pizza, and thankfully they had it ready.

A group of two friends and I called around 8:45 p.m. because we know their kitchen closes at 10. We asked how long the list was and if we would be able to get a table if we came right away. The hostess who answered said, ""There are only seven people on the list right now,"" so we told her we would be coming down in 10 or 15 minutes. ""Great, see you then,"" she said.

So, we rushed down there by car, and when we arrived ten minutes later around 8:55 and asked the hostess to please put our name on the list, she told us they could no longer seat any more walk-ins and we would have to try our luck sitting at the bar, which was completely full. We explained that we just called 10 minutes ago and someone (apparently this same hostess) encouraged us to come in. ""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""There's just nothing I can do at this point. We can't seat anyone else.""

My problem is definitely not that they don't seat walk-ins after a certain time, as that's totally understandable for a busy restaurant. My problem is that the hostess should have communicated to us over the phone that there would be a risk of this happening if we drove there. Instead, she never mentioned there would be a possibility of them filling up and encouraged us to come down.

I've read Ancora's pizza rules on their website and their goal is to produce a product that contains simple and fresh ingredients. The toppings on a pizza are unimportant if the dough and sauce are not done correctly and Ancora does both very well. Their dough is very simple, no oil or added ingredients. Just flour and water mainly. Their sauce is also well done as it does not overwhelm the pizza. All their pizzas have very few ingredients, not ten things thrown on top like some places.

Though I was disappointed that this location also follows the ""No reservations"" policy of their other restaurants, my guest and I decided to wait it out. 

It was a Monday night and the hostess checked us in by name and indicated there was about a 20 minute wait. The hostess also indicated that there were two (2) available seats at the bar, since a couple had just left. My guest and I headed to take advantage of the bar seating, since no one ahead of us was interested. We approached the bar area, only to be rudely stopped by Chandra Chifici, Owner, Deanie's Uptown. She flippantly remarked that we needed to first sign in with the hostess instead of heading to the bar. When I indicated that we'd already signed in and the hostess subsequently directed us to the available bar seating, she completely ignored me and escorted us back to the front. She refused to seat us and instead chose the next folks on the list (who did not want bar seating). She also never apologized for the misunderstanding. Rude and unacceptable. 

Despite the rude behavior of Owner Chandra Chifici, we waited patiently to be seated...wherever we were told.

Once seated at a table, I ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell and my guest ordered the pick 3 combo fried seafood dinner with fries. Sadly, the oysters were haphazardly shucked and there was an unusually large amount of broken shells in eat bite. I was constantly picking out small pieces of shell with each oyster. As one who eats a LOT of oysters on the half shell, this was so disappointing, especially for a seafood restaurant. Note: I did not eat any of the fried seafood but my guest commented that it was ""just ok.""

The restaurant was relatively disheveled and the staff was slow to turn tables after guests left. This was seemingly a large contribution to the delay in seating new guests. 

When I went to use the ladies room, I was unpleasantly surprised. It was absolutely disgusting. Paper everywhere, a VERY soiled toilet, dirty sink, and filthy floor...badly in need of bleach. Since this restaurant is relatively new (only opened a few months), then it is inconceivable why the ladies restroom was in such a poor state. 

Additionally, if Owner Chandra Chifici expects to have long-term success Uptown, then she must change her tune. Even the greatest restaurant will fail with poor customer service from management. In truth, Owner Chandra Chifici would GREATLY benefit from customer service refresher training and better manners...

With so many other delicious dining options Uptown, there's absolutely no reason to be treated rudely at this New Deanie's location. No thank you, Chandra Chifici.",2019-03-20 03:17:06

The topping selections here lean a little more conservatively than do the options at other pizza spots, but there's nonetheless something for any palette. A good chunk of the menu is vegetarian-friendly, including the delicious melanzane pie with tender, rich roasted eggplant, creamy straciatella cheese, and tangy chunks of San Marzano tomato. The more carnivorous crudo pizza also tasted excellent and brought gossamer thin sheets of prosciutto cotto (more tender than its dry cured cousin) paired nicely with funky yet smooth buffalo mozzarella. The crusts struck the appropriate balance between thin crispiness and glutinous stretch, each bite offered pleasant chewiness, a good punch of fermented flavor, and a nice bit of char.

The rotollo lived up to the considerable hype; the combination of nutty pistachio pesto, porky mortadella, and cheese harmonized rather well and made for a delicious snack. The canned beer program at Pizzeria Vetri is similarly impressive, and the draft beer list is rather small but well-selected. One major pet peeve I have with the space is its communal seating. I understand the purpose is to promote conviviality among patrons, but I'd rather enjoy my pizza in relative privacy than bump elbows and make friends (as curmudgeonly as that sounds). Truth be told, the pies here aren't leaps and bounds ahead of other Neopolitan live pie joints, and that speaks more to the quality of our gourmet pizza scene than Pizzeria Vetri's pies. Vetri's new place is thus a solid addition to any pizza rotation. These are five star pies, but minus one for the seating.",2014-04-09 18:31:34

I take my wife out to Valentines Weekend Dinner and get 5 PM reservations. We walk in and there is no greeting at all, just 2 ladies staring at us like we had no business in there. We tell them we have reservations and they proceed to sit us. Our waitress comes and is the most ignorant waitress I have ever had in my life, no welcome nothing just here is your menu and walk away. (She was the sweetest to the old couple next to us even saying happy valentines day to them.) Anyway, we order one filet and one strip steak cooked medium. The food comes out 5 minutes later with hardly any grill marks and so rare I actually had to send the food back. (This is the first time, as I never once sent something back) Never one apology for the way undercooked steak or anything. Get it back to an actual cooked rare steak which I ate. My wife's filet was also incredibly rare. The service here was the worst I have ever experienced in my life. They rushed us out of there since we were home not even an hour after arriving. The two stars are for the food which was good except the cold stale champagne cake. I will never go back here and give my business to other local establishments that know how to treat their customer and cook an actual steak to the temperature you desire.",2014-02-17 17:37:27

We were invited to seat ourselves, and I chose the back room, as I heard the unmistakable sound of a guitar and country crooning...another delightful surprise; music with our dinner. I didn't have a huge appetite on my visit, but had enough to order the pulled pork plate with 2 sides and a corn cake...I went with their vinegar slaw and turnip greens. Hubby had the ribs, so I got to sample those too. The pulled pork was great; it had a pervasive smokiness and a nice meaty flavor. Sauces come table side, and their mild, which has a distinct vinegar note, was a perfect accompaniment. The sides were tasty also. I liked the ribs, but the pulled pork was the winner here for me.

Whatever issues I may have once had with this restaurant have dissolved completely, and I joyfully and enthusiastically pronounce my love for this wonderful little bit of heaven on earth. When we arrived for our latest evening of indulgence, we discovered that the menu had been changed and some of our old favorites were missing. My husband's mood downshifted from expectant to irritated very quickly, but he need not have worried; the items we chose were sufficiently delicious to turn things around. We started with our usual 2 dozen P&J oysters, which were better than they usually are here. I usually get a French 75 and/or a bourbon old fashioned here, and they're still some of the best cocktails in town. We had a little glitch with my husband's drink, which at first had no vodka in it and then, after being doctored up by the bartender, had way too much vodka in it. He switched beverages and all was well. 
So one change in the menu was to add shrimp and grits (Shrimp En Cocotte), and, as this is one of my favorite dishes, I chose it. Good move. Their's may well be the best executed of this Southern standard that I've ever had; creamy and spicy roasted jalapeño cheese grits with smoky Andouille and green onion sausage, redolent of that full shrimp flavor that lets you know they've infused the dish with some stock, and sizable Gulf shrimp. Perfection. Really, if they never added another dish to this menu, I could be happy with this one forever. We didn't save room for dessert, but that didn't stop us from ordering one to share. If the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Tart with Coconut Sorbet is still on the menu when you read this, get it. Coffee as always is great here too.",2014-10-27 17:43:25

Aloha Ansley is in a newly renovated building along West Bay Drive. The storefront is brightly painted in a Hawaiian theme. The colorful theme carries through inside, with a hanging surfboard and Hawaiian music in the background. There are about 10 high top tables for dine-in. 

You order at the counter from the menu board; each entree is prepared fresh.  We tried the Volcano Flow Salad and the Maui Poke.

The salad is a tasty combo of mixed greens, diced tomatoes & peppers, dressed with black bean corn salsa, a dollop of guacamole and served with a side of homemade Hawaiian BBQ dressing. The dressing, with a ginger base, is excellent and enhances the combination of flavors without overpowering.  We chose BBQ chicken for a little extra protein.  This adds a big portion of shredded chicken, lightly flavored with Hawaiian BBQ seasonings.   A really good salad! 

We also tried the Maui Poke bowl. This is made up of a generous portion of imported-from-Hawaii Big Eye tuna, diced & house-marinated.  The tuna is served with diced tomatoes, mixed greens and pickled cucumbers, then garnished with sliced avocado and black sesame seeds. All of this is added to a bed of sticky coconut jasmine rice.  One of the better Poke bowls I've had - no frills but super fresh ingredients and the right proportions make this one shine. 

Honorable mention for using all biodegradable plates, bowls & forks.  Dinner for two with soft drinks is $24.

This place is a tourist trap, plain and simple. I'm not unsympathetic to the limitations of (what I presume is) an onboard kitchen, and Moshulu does deserve some credit for holding down the fort back when the waterfront was all but abandoned. And, sure, the view of twinkling lights across the Delaware River is quite romantic, and I've never had a server that was anything but nice.

But good lord, the food is terrible. And at those prices, that's unforgivable. I have to assume Moshulu gets by with an out-of-town crowd that comes for the novelty of sitting on a boat and watching the bridges sparkle in the sunset, and if that's what you want, you will get it.

Not a big deal, just technicalities. 

I came in for brunch with my boyfriend and sat outside.  I kind of got a diner vibe once I walked in the restaurant, however, make no mistake, the food was far from diner quality.  We started with the tomato gazpacho (morr puree than creamy but certainly was filled with flavor).  I normally dislike puree soup but this was really good. I had the smoked duck benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side while my bf had the country style breakfast with bacon, charred grapefruit. Ok, so I was actually expecting a thicker piece of duck than sliced beef like duck. However, it was overall very good without being too salty which is normally the reason why I don't like smoked salmon on my benedict.  Glad I got to try the duck version benedict.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the hike fries which were a fusion of being a chip but filled with potato filling. 
We ended our meal with the banana granola coffee cake, served warm and moist. No complaints there. The granola were toasty and crunchy, loved it. 
Oh for our drinks. We had the ice cafe Brulee (I thought was a little disappointing because it tasted like a cold brew) and coconut Chai lemonade (one word, INTERESTING but not my cup of tea).

My problem with the Chinese restaurants in general are they put WAAAAYY too much sweet and sour sauce on everything....Just in case anyone of you guys care to know...the only sweet and sour dish I had when I was kid was Sweet and sour fish. 

The artificial coloring on the pork we had... just.....sigh!!! I can see why people likes PF Chang or Olive garden, not that those food were bad,,,but if you respect your palate or passionate about food..you adventure out.

Started with the hot and sour soup...it taste OK but the ingredients were like 4 out of 10 to the original...  

Sweet & sour pork...this is the dish that makes me rather eat Arby's

Schezuan style pork (its not on the menu..I had asked the waitress changed from eggplant to this)...its a totally different dish. Although I am not complaining here since its Cantonese chef cooking back there.. you just don't asked Mexican chef make Sushi (don't want to point finger, it happened)..it just not fair.   

I had asked the seasonal veggie dish and they did a decent job which is the only dish I can shut up and eat.

Snow-peas and shrimps was the other dish my friend ordered...I didn't even try it...don't ask me why but looks pretty good.

Service was good that always can add another star.

The reason why we have Chinese restaurants like Guilin are something we can extend this review to social studies so I rather stop here and off my soap box!!

I am just a foodie after all!",2011-01-05 14:56:35

We weren't to impressed, but once we learned they would be redoing the place and eventually updating the menu we vowed to try it again.

Well we finally got around to trying it again this past weekend. We had a 45 minute wait, which is a little long for May, but what can you do there were a lot of big parties taking up all the tables. Hubby got a drink from the bar, eventually, while I grabbed a spot to sit and wait. 

We had eaten at Rockaway not to long ago and I left a little underwhelmed. My grouper wasn't the best and it didn't leave me wanting more Frenchy's. But we had vowed to return to this new location. At Outpost we started with the fish spread. It was good. It was fish spread. Our food came out very quickly after we got the appetizer. Would have preferred a little more time, but not a big deal. My husband ordered the Fire Island Grouper Sandwich (I think that's the name, something with fire in it) and I opted for the chicken salad pita for a change of pace and because I have a friend who goes to Frenchy's specifically for this. I figured it was worth a shot. The pita was big and served with delicious fruit. My hubby and I were joking because when this place was Island Outpost I ordered a salad with tropical fruit on top which ended up being a can of dole fruit - yuck. Frenchy's gave me FRESH kiwi, strawberries, banana, cantelope and honeydew (which wasn't quite ripe) I took half of the pita home and had dinner the next night. My husband let me try a bite of his sandwich and it was really delicious. The fish was perfect. Super fresh and much better than my Rockaway experience. It left me wanting to come back.

They advertise right on the menu that nothing is ever frozen, if their beef is that good, give me a choice of how I want it cooked.

It was a decent amount for the three gals; we were full but not stuffed to the gills. The BBQ beef nachos were so delicious; I hope they put that on the menu permanently. The tots were also amazing, and we liked the tacos as well. We also got concha and cochito ice cream sandwiches to share, because why not?!

It would be nice (and the restaurant could save quite a bit on cost) if they put in a soda fountain.

I came for the lunch buffet, which is an excellent value, but see that the standard menu offers so many choices, including pizza for take out,

I helped myself to three or four plates from the buffet - 1) salad plate, 2) pasta and other stuff plate, and 3) pizza plate.  Everything was very good.  I liked that the salad bar offers feta cubes, one of my favorite types of cheese.  I liked that the pasta choices included large stuffed shells.  And I liked that the pizza area offers around four different varieties, though I limited myself to two of them this time.

A few other kudos are in order.  I had forgotten that a small cup of soup was also included.  On the particular day I went in, it was turkey avgolemono (that's Greek for lemon flavored) and it was very tasty.  Then, there are little baklava triangles in the salad bar area that are obviously intended to be dessert fare.  I can slam dunk those little baklava triangles down the hatch the way someone laying on the couch who watches soaps and Oprah can slam dunk those Oreos.  And, obviously, from avgolemono soup and baklava, this is an Italian pizza-pasta place with some Greek staples, all of which I love.

Country Pizza Italian Grill's lunch buffet is also offered 7 days a week!  It's not just a Monday through Friday thing.  I paid $8.99.  (From looking around and listening to some people talk, it's obvious it has local ""regulars,"" which is a good sign.) The service by the friendly young lady, the tidiness and air conditioned comfort of the interior, and the amply sized parking lot were also pluses.  It's not fine dining, so don't be complaining given the respectable value.

Just find Country Pizza Italian Grill, which is on the frontage road to crazy US 19, Pinellas County's half baked attempt at a north-south freeway.  It's also technically in Largo, which abuts Clearwater.  And be sure to make some time for snooze time afterwards and to plan on a light dinner.",2020-08-18 17:01:16

These guys have been around for a while now with a competitor across the street no less who also has been around  making a phenomenal cheese steak in DaLessandros. 

The differences from these two are:

First- you can enjoy a frosty pint / mug , bottled beer, or you can go with something stronger like liquor  with your cheese steak.
 
Second - The fried long hots in oil types of  hot peppers and pickles bar they offer you if you want to take your steak to a different level.

Third- they accept credit cards, and at times are open later than the rival across the way.

A great  high calorie induced, greasy flavored  by this I mean a marinate from the whole day types of grease on the grill is what I am screaming! If you are a person who doesn't like a good flavorful cheese steak with all the add-ons and is worried about the grease factor, DON'T GO IN !

I've been to the place at least 20 times And it is definitely getting worse each time. But it could be great if they got a new chef and utilized the space. 

I really want to like this place but tonight might have been my last visit. I shared Ahi tuna w noodles and it was covered in pink peppercorns and it is not nice getting multiple of those in your mouth. I can't get the awful peppercorn taste out of my mouth. We had to send back Mac and cheese bc it was fishy and watery. Further, the waitress even agreed that they always take back the ahi Tuna dish w a lot of left over peppercorns. Maybe the manAgement should do something about that- it's gross to have a mouth full of pink peppercorns and it is pointless to have a garnish that is hardly edible. 

Finally, DON'T GeT a burger here- horrible. They can't cook a burger medium rare and it is chewy. Very disappointed w the food here.

Final opinion: come here for beer, chicken fingers, mussels and French fries- NOTHINg ELSE!!! And be ready to wait at least an hour for a seat. 

And if I was repetitive, it was bc of the beer!!!",2014-07-04 01:34:03

The coconut curry with shrimp, which is also offered with chicken or tofu. I know I'm not the only one that loves it because last time I went nearly every table had it. They've definitely struck gold with this dish. I love the portion size because you can certainly get at least 2 meals out of it.  If not familiar with this dish its very similar to Thai rice dishes. If not familiar with that either, its basically just a party in your mouth. It's sweet and savory, its everything you want and more. They also have some great appetizers. The spring rolls are pretty standard. The calamari is really fresh and tasty.

The service is always really attentive and nice. You will never thirst because they are so on top of their refill game. They have indoor and outdoor seating and they've done a really good job of shielding the outdoor seating area from the ugly street that it sits on. They also have fans and heaters to offset whatever weather mother nature is throwing at us that day.

We stopped in here last night after doing some shopping at the Legends.

Restaurant was deserted at dinner hour - only 4 other tables had patrons.

Service was still slow. Getting water refills was tedious and required multiple reminders.

The food - I cringe thinking back on it to write about it.

'Not full order' of Beer Battered shrimp - not full = 6 shrimp. Beer battered = all batter no shrimp. Sub'd for fried okra instead of hush puppies - Okra was cold. I ate one and pushed the rest aside.

Fiance's dish - Shrimp fettuccine - sauce was flavorful but not overpowering. Shrimp were well cooked. Great dish. Took the leftover home but they tasted horrible reheated. 

Dessert:
1 order of regular beignets (4 average sized beignets)
1 order of stuffed beignets (1 large home run pie shaped beignet stuffed with a thick hot fudge type sauce). 

Both were FAR, FAR better than the food... and the service.

The menu was quite impressive. I enjoyed viewing the combination of ingredients they used to depict flavors from around the country and the globe. I actually compared some of the ingredients used from various countries and found it to be authentic to the region. I ordered the Poi boy Maui but changed it up a bit, as that is what I like to do :). I had the teriyaki sauce but instead of the pineapple relish, I had the cherry pepper relish. Can you say Delicious! I love spicy so this was right up my alley. The sausage was great and the pork belly was perfectly seasoned and juicy, an added bonus to the sausage.

That said, we waited..

I'm a sucker for cornbread so I went with the special this month - they described it as a kind of southwestern eggs benedict with pork belly..but it was just two fried eggs on thin cornbread with a few pieces of pork belly and jalapeños. It was very tasty but it was definitely NOT a ""Benedict"" in any sense of the word or what we're all used to. My wife did the corned beef has, which again had good flavor but did not look very ""hash"" like. Her dish was really wet - from the soggy hash browns (not browned) to the runny egg it melded into something she couldn't finish. I tasted it a couple times, and although tasty for me, it was very sloppy. 

What's with cooks not knowing how to make eggs over MEDIUM?? This is a standard thing in cooking schools - a fried egg / sunny side up is just that, not flipped and cooked in one side and runny. Over easy is flipped and cooked quickly on the top side - still runny. Over MEDIUM should not be runny at all, but ooze slightly, and over hard is just that - fully cooked yoke. Apparently the cooks here don't know the difference..

The regular coffee was no better than Macdonald's, and the mimosa just so-so. Atmosphere was energized - like I said there was an hour wait to get in and folks were definitely taking their time at their tables.

The 3 roll special is great - they give you a lot of choices, and the rolls are larger and more filling than other sushi places nearby. The spicy white tuna roll with apple is really tasty, although they do stuff their spicy rolls with panko so you don't really appreciate the fish as much. On the other hand, there's a good portion of salmon in the salmon avocado roll, and both times I've had it, it's been very fresh and sweet. 

Generous, fresh pieces of sashimi in the sushi bar entrees. The specialty rolls are pricey but good - I especially liked the green tea roll.

Dry Pot Style with Tofu/Garlic Sauce Style Chicken - Very good to taste. Though a little dry so I prefer ordering fried rice or some gravy rather than eating this with plain rice.
Three Cup Chicken - Good to taste but I found it too much salt in it. So did not enjoy it as much.

I was actually excited. It sat in my bookmark feed on Yelp for a couple of months. I opted to go one weekend day when I had some free time and so happened to be in the neighborhood during the lunch hour. 

It's been established that this is the previous location for Sushi Garden. Once inside, it looks utterly different. The bar is still toward the front and the sushi bar and line toward the east, but the decor and mood are so different. 

First off, I arrive and am immediately greeted by two staff members. It was very light for traffic -- only two other tables seated with one person at the bar. I found that the server was very attentive and was ready to take my order at the right time. 

I did take a look at the lunch buffet, but opted against it. I wanted to see what they had to offer for sushi. I went with the $1 option. Sushi at $1?! Pretty sweet. 

As I sat waiting for my order, I observed the space. 

The decor is a dark grey with silver tones throughout. It reminds me of 1980s era lounge bars. Not sure why. I wasn't anywhere near the drinking age in the 1980s and, thus, would never have been in a bar. Anyway, the carpet has been removed (thank goodness!) to give way to nice flooring. Also, a few television sets are installed set to sports and entertainment shows. 

FYI: They have a kid's menu for those 12 and under. But it's pricey: $9. 

But, in all, I'm feeling pretty good at this moment at the restaurant. 

Soon, my sushi arrives. I went with the nigiri. First thing I notice is that the sushi look like they are wearing mini skirts. The fish was that tiny, so tiny that looking from above, you could see much of the sushi rice. 

Whatever, I thought. 

All told, I went with the mackerel, red snapper, salmon, spicy scallops, tuna, yellowtail, conch and white tuna. What I noticed right away is that the fish tasted fresh, but that it did not have that much flavor. Mackerel and salmon, in particular, tend to be luscious oily cuts. But these were somewhat dry. It was strange. 

It was like a miniature, light (read: lite) version of real sushi. 

I did try a roll: the popcorn lobster roll, which is basically a California roll with nuggets of lobster and what is called ""yummy sauce"". Seriously, that's what it's called. It's printed like that right on the menu. 

But I didn't like it at all. I could see the lobster. I could see it right there teeming with this thick, orange-color sauce. The sauce did it in. It was way too heavy -- like a slice of melted cheddar cheese. 

The total cost was about $16. Honestly, I left wishing I'd just paid the full price of sushi. I wonder if, because of the $1 pricetag, they go skimpy. I would rather cut a check for quality than to skimp on the price for what amounted to substandard sushi. 

So, all that to say that I will be going back at some point, but most likely to try out the dinner menu.",2012-12-01 19:53:58

I have nothing but positive things to say! I loved the decor and the atmosphere. There aren't tons and tons of places to sit and do work but there was never more than one or two people waiting for a seat at a time, and the wait wasn't long for anyone. I ended up asking someone if I could sit at their small table with them and it was plenty of space, so if you're okay with sitting near someone than this is a great place to do work.

Because I stayed so long studying, I ended up getting a few things (also because I felt bad staying for hours and not getting more than one thing!) The latte was good but standard. I had a peanut butter banana chocolate donut which was delicious. And then I had a plain black coffee which you could tell was actually GOOD coffee.

Having been here many times, I can attest to its overall quality and dependability.

In terms of food, they offer all of the usual suspects, but their preparation, seasoning, and sauces are a cut above most other places in the Nashville area. The house tomato salsa is above average, and they have a few off-the-menu salsas that you can ask for, of which, my favorite is their fiery habanero. Holy cow, this stuff is good, and highly addictive to the heat-seeking palate. Their red and green burrito sauces are also notably better than any I've had in town.

A few menu items really stand out. My absolute favorite is their chile Colorado, probably my favorite Mexican entree in town. The beef tips are served in the most delicious spicy, tomatillo sauce. It's rich, smoky, savory, spicy, and tangy all at once. I would pay big bucks for the recipe. Another favorite of mine is their large Texas chimichanga, which I recommend with steak instead of the chicken listed on the menu. Speaking of Texas, my girlfriend hails from the Lone Star State, and for what it's worth, she considers Pueblo Real the most legit Mexican restaurant in the area. Her favorite dish is the enchiladas Suizas.

Prices are generally on par with other Mexican restaurants, if not a tad cheaper, but food quality and portion size make Pueblo Real a better value and more desirable destination in my book. Oh, and their lunch menu prices are outstanding.

The employees here are super friendly, including owners Jesus and José. The atmosphere is fun, and the noise level can be on the loud side during busier shifts, including 1/2 off margaritas night (Tuesday), trivia night (Wednesday), and weekends. The custom Pueblo Real seats and booths are visually a little much, and they really cram in as many seats as possible, at the slight expense of the customer's comfort. Minor criticisms aside, Pueblo Real is a reliable winner in my book. If you're in the Franklin area, try immediately. If you're in Nashville, seriously consider making the trip out here.",2014-03-17 00:37:55

I've been here a number of times for corporate events and dining out in University city, and my reaction is consistently the same.

Pros: This place has a combination of traditional Mexican fare as well as American standards, giving plenty of options to the guest. 

Cons: The way the menu works is rather confusing, I find that when I need to order for myself, and food is not simply provided in a banquet style, I never know how much food to order, and leave hungry or annoyed at the wait staff for allowing me to order too much (presumably to add to their tip). Additionally, it does not make sense to have a family style menu that features tacos. They come in orders of three, which is NEVER the right amount for any party really ever. What I would advise the restaurant do is allow orders of tacos to be served in multiples of three if they'd like, or preferably to allow mix and match tacos that can be ordered alone or in any quantity you so desire. Lastly, this restaurant does a poor job of describing what their traditional Mexican fare actually is, leaving diners who are not used to traditional Mexican aimless and virtually confined to the tex-mex style.

Overall: This restaurant is decidedly elevated Mexican fare, however, it is not a great value, and the menu is very difficult to navigate.",2015-12-08 01:21:01

I like the American-themed menu, but the food just never lives up to its description. A few trips ago I tried the mac & cheese as an appetizer and was very impressed. I did think $8.50 was a little steep for a small dish of just plain noodles and cheese, but I enjoyed it so I didn't have any complaints. Over the weekend I had a mac craving and thought Jones would be the perfect destination. However, this time around the dish tasted completely sour. It was like they were trying to throw in too many flavors, and just ruined it. It's rare when I don't finished a plate of mac & cheese, but this was almost inedible. During that same trip my boyfriend ordered the matzo ball soup. Again, almost $8 for one matzo ball, and it wasn't even hot.

I'm not a pizza snob by any stretch of the imagination, but I can't imagine how Seasons Pizza could win any awards, at least not with the pizza they currently foist on their patrons.

My biggest problem with their pizza is the crust. I've tried Seasons pizza in its regular and thin crust variations, but the crust never seems right. I can't put my finger on what the problem is, but it just doesn't work as pizza crust. I prefer the crust found in most frozen pizzas to that of Seasons. The crust is the foundation of any pizza, and if the crust is no good then it's game over for the pizza.

I've tried a few other selections from Seasons' menu - calzones, salads, chicken wings. Everything was adequate, but unremarkable. In the end, if you can't get halfway decent pizza at a pizza joint, what's the point?

I've walked by 417 Union more times than I care to admit without ever having entered the premises. Slap my feet with disdain.

The ambiance reminds me of classy with a mix of classic. I was surprised that it was rather quiet in the upstairs dining room. Since I turn up on the loud side, I was concerned I was going to destroy the room with volume. However, after the lunch crowd filtered in, I found that I was no more a nuisance than any other patron. 

I was promptly greeted upon entering the establishment. I also suggested a specific type of table and was kindly guided to my preference. The crowd is more of the decision making business crowd. A well-dressed crowd filled the seats. In some way, I felt as though I fell back into time where everyone dressed and felt important. It was a gentle reminder of how former generations appreciate feeling classy while enjoying well-prepared dishes.

I had the grilled catfish sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. If you know my reviews, you know that cheese is a staple. The sandwich came with a bun that was lightly toasted on the inside which was a perfect compliment to the lightly grilled catfish. The Cajun tarter was delightful and a nice twist from what could be expected from a remoulade sauce. The mac and cheese was perfect. The macaroni was al dente and not the overly Southern meat and three soft version. The cheese was a well-crafted thick style that was rich and held the macaroni together just right. 

My lunch friend has the Strawberry Caesar salad. It looked wonderfully fresh considering it is on the cusp of spring. 

The staff was fairly attentive. But, as anyone knows, lunch crowds are the toughest. They come in in a hurry and leave before the serve anticipates. 

I'm looking forward to frequent trips here. I also believe this would be an excellent place for a date and a nice dinner out downtown. The prices are reasonable. The high ceilings have that feel of a Victorian. But, this is a building amongst others in a downtown environment. With a few more trips, I'll update this review and hope future experiences will increase the starage (new word).",2014-03-26 16:23:25

First, the bar area is usually bustling with a star studded cast during big nights: Country Music Award, concerts, or simply weekend nights. They make an excellent martini and at the price of $10-15 each, you'll be sure to move on after a few. 

Second, the food here is on par with an over excessive Americanized serving portion. This, helps justify the cost of the meal. Having been to much more expensive places and received half the serving, I feel the over all portions to price ratio are acceptable on any budget. 

Third, the staff here are knowledgeable about both the menu and the clientele. Engage them in conversation and they have amazing and fascinating stories to tell. 

Fourth, if you live in Nashville, bring your our Tupperware. There is definitely food to be brought home. 

Lastly, get the chocolate cake for desert! One piece here could feed four! 

Oh, and watch out, this is a tourist destination. That means there is a 25% liquor tax on all adult beverages!

I'm not even sure where to start, but I left completely offended by this meal. I would NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone. From the uncomfortable service to the poorly executed food, to the odd ambiance, it was simply a bad experience. 

We ordered the kanella platter, I ordered the manouri cheese ravioli and my husband ordered the fish dish accompanied by chickpeas etc. Maybe 15 minutes later a small plate which we later learned was the ""platter"" was set down on our table. Four cherry tomatoes, a small bunch of greek salad and two falafels on a bed of sauce. This was simple food, the beet falafel was decent, everything else was your basic stuff, that we make at home on a regular Wednesday. Then, came our entrees. It's not a good sign when you have to look for ingredients. As I looked at my husband's dish, I was having a hard time locating the fish; it was small even fine dining standards. (And kanella is not fine dining). To add insult to injury - the chickpeas and other accoutrements were overly salty. Then, my ravioli. What can one say about this poorly executed dish? How hard IS it to cook four ravioli to be al dente? And, I'd love to tell you that the mint pesto was delicious but all I could taste was salt. And then were the sad zucchini blossoms, which had been so unfortunately misused - they had simply smushed them into the pesto, so they were soggy, and inedible. Really? $22 for undercooked pasta in salt sauce with soggy elephant ears? Nope, no thank you. To be clear -it's not about paying for food - but if you are going to charge that much, then it better be excellent, or maybe even good, but it can't, it simply can't, be that bad. 

Then there was the very inconsistent service; one person came to take our order and read us the specials. A second guy sort of waited on our table, and re-read the specials even though we said we had already heard them, and a third person came to deal with our check, mainly because of the look on my face after I had been served the entree.

All in all so incredibly disappointing.",2013-09-03 21:50:09

I was willing to overlook it during Jazz Fest when I went in with 5 people and we took a seat to get out of the way of the crowd while one of our group ordered.  The manager came up and asked us not to take a table until we got our food.  I understood his point and we got up, but since there was really no place to stand we were in the way of everyone one (we had two kids with us which didn't help), and immediately a woman from 4 spots behind us in line sat down and started texting while her husband waited in line to order.  The manager said NOTHING to her.  So he is inflicting his control issues on us but evidently not on anyone else.  I figured they were busy and anyone can have a bad day.  But yesterday this guy was extremely rude again.  We asked what kind of bread they had because we couldn't remember the name of the one we liked.  The woman helping us named two kinds but it wasn't one of them so we asked ""is that all you have?""  The manger pipes in ""Well it IS late in the day!"" in a really obnoxious manner.  We responded that we weren't really talking to him.  Turned out they did have the kind we wanted and the woman got it for us.  The women who work there are very very nice and I LOVE their cupcakes, pastries, iced coffee (and their grilled cheese is AMAZING).  But this guy needs to go on vacation or something or find a job where he doesn't intereact with the public.   His personality would be better suited to debt collection or something where he can let his general bad attitude work for him.

When you walk in it's very clean and free of any one particular food odor. There were about 15 people inside already and more just pouring in. 

You are greeted immediately by the owner or one of his extremely nice staff.  We were seated right away and offered to get a drink order done. They have a nice big menu with Mexican and American food to offer. Half of my group got breakfast and half of my group got lunch.  The food came out within 10 minutes and everything is piping hot.
I ended up ordering the chicken Caesar wrap with french fries. My french fries were super hot and sprinkled with some amazing seasoning. The French fry is a combination between a regular french fry and a steak fry. Super delicious and super hot. My chicken Caesar wrap it's self was perfectly balanced with sauce to lettuce to meat. It wasn't too dry or too wet... It was just right. However, the texture of the chicken was a little chewy and a little gummy and it was waaay over seasoned with garlic. I was able to pick the chicken out and eat around it just the same. 
I wasn't going to say anything because every single person at the table was happy with their meal and everything looks fantastic! However when the owner came over to ask if I wanted a box, I told him no. He seemed concerned on why and inquired if everything was ok?  I explain the situation above. He insisted on removing it from the bill and comped my entire meal! I ask him not to do that because I was happy to pay for it, totally 100% out of my normal character, but he insisted and said it was the right thing to do!NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL SERVICE! 

When it came time for us to pay the bill, my iced tea, side of ranch ( I don't know if they charge for that... And it was super good ) and my meal were completely removed. I asked to at least pay for the iced tea, he insisted on removing  the entire thing, apologized and apologized. He told me "" we are better than that! Please come back to let us show you"".

Our food came out quickly. The first thing I noticed was that my crepe was about half the size of my friends! I instantly was disappointed. Not only was my crepe pretty small, but it wasn't even very good. The smoked salmon was not what I am used to and it was more of a fishy and unseasoned flavor.. not the salty, smooth taste that I was expecting.

But at the same time I also felt that  their were a few key flaws in execution that prevented it from being a winner. While Bar Ly just falls short on some of things as well, it does offer some serious upgrades that makes it worth visiting during either their exceptional Happy Hour or the day of a big game.

One of the things that didn't sell me on Tazia was its lack of an interesting drink menu. But Bar Ly significantly improved upon that by bringing in 40 taps that ranges from basics like Yuengling & Blue Moon to Heavy Hitters from Ommegang and Stones, and upping the ante with a pretty impressive signature martini list. The fact that a few of these are put up on the special Happy Hour menu that happens 7 days a week for a regular and occasional late night option is pretty awesome. It also helps that their made by some pretty impressive bartenders (including a Trocadero veteran).

The Tazia menu was fairly uninspiring Americanized Asian fare with a few basic bar food options like chicken wings. While the Bar Ly menu doesn't stray too far from from that path, offerings like the chicken gizzards or bacon wrapped quail eggs skewers, and banh mi are pretty inspiring. But things like their sushi and duck dumplings left much to be desired.

The creepy randomness of the bathrooms being in a bizarre hallway that's completely separate from the bar is weird. but other than that and the few aforementioned fronts, Bar Ly is a pretty solid bar overall, and perhaps the Philly best in the sports bar category.",2014-04-28 05:26:02

In a rare time there comes a place that maintains same ownership, and may very well maintain the same name that decides to pull the 180 degree and initiate some serious changes, only to go for the 360 degree. During that time you may find yourself hating the significant changes, yet can't help but like what it has become in the process.

I'd be the first to jump up and decree that to the Khyber, if it didn't prove to be such a confusing bastard in the process, that still manages to be one in certain ways.

If you look at the confusing path (http://www.philebrity.com/2010/07/29/city-paper-makes-cover-story-sized-bed-that-khyber-owner-is-not-completely-full-of-shit/), you'll find a story that flip flops throughout many situations. From selling the business, to not at all. From getting rid of the live music that it was known for to not at all; to doing so after all(while building a stage upstairs, but that's another story). From deciding to go Japanese Izakaya and do something that no place in Philly has done; to going southern BBQ and doing something that a number of places have done. In a nutshell, I don't even know where to make head or tails of that (and I appreciate you if you tried to read beyond the well place link that backs it up!)

But besides that I also feel that their giving up on live music was more or less a colossal cop out. Sure, it was at a time where places like Johnny Brenda's, Kung Fu Necktie, etc.; were delivering better shows. But rather than put the $$$$$ towards re-branding, you could have probably put significantly less towards looking into what you were doing differently, and fix it! while the other places had revamped sound systems, yours was more or less the same old 'ish. While other places maintained different bookers that maintained in different ways (house bookers, R5 Productions, websites, Flash Mob Productions, etc.!), Khyber more or less maintained just one that eventually got out of touch towards the end. Remedy both, and maintain what they had going on upstairs on certain days, and the product may have been fixed for significantly less. 

But I've knocked the Khyber for long enough. Because despite all the angst I feel toward it sometimes, it still maintains a lot of things that I love about it! The Khyber has always been a beer lovers paradise, and the new selection that it brings in only cements the fact that it may very well always be one. It also earns a gold star for staying true to the classic Happy Hour that it used to have! the food (especially what ever chilli you'll find them serving) is always impressive. As are the special events that they host!

Another wild card that is still as yet more of an undetermined, is the Khyber's upstairs area. Other than adding a few tables; and a stage which may or may not be necessary considering how they ostracized themselves from live music; upstairs has been more or less kept the same (they even kept the notorious bathroom - http://www.yelp.com/topic/philadelphia-the-worst-bathroom-in-philly#4qA-E0qL4ynFhI_eF5f81g). I can't say whether its a good thing or bad thing yet, because the Khyber hasn't really done a good job of promoting upstairs compared to how they used to, and have already lost things like a solid karaoke night in the process.

But if The Khyber managed to apply  the necessary tweaks to upstairs (whether it be as an extension of the restaurant, or especially a secondary club/music venue option), while being able to maintain the quality that their dishing out downstairs; then it could very well be on the FULL CIRCLE towards perfection. Therefore this review will hopefully be continued in admiration.",2011-06-02 05:36:28

How I wish I knew about you sooner than Saturday morning (your coffee did a good job of bringing me back to life). You might just be everything I've wanted in a coffee house. People i know and haven't seen in age's happily sitting and drinking caffeinated goods, tasty baked goods for reasonable prices, and all kinds of interesting art and free publications to look at. I think I'm in love (and not just with your cute baristas).

Seriously though I randomly walked by Benna's while leaving my cousin's house and it's a cool little inviting joint. I'm not sure if it offers free wi-fi, and I can't tell you if it has any free trade coffee varieties.

On the scale of lady bosses, Philly's best named bar EVER was an Arianna Huffington - liberal with its use of quality alcohol, purposeful with the fresh ingredients found within the cocktails, and creative with its overall presentation!

Despite it being within a couple blocks of the 13th & South area that I've known for decades, Writers Block Rehab is one of those spots that I wouldn't have come across if it weren't for my drinking partner suggesting it out of the blue for a happy hour. And it led me to a spot that's essentially a speakeasy within plain site since its on a perfectly random side street, but towers over a parking lot on 13th and Spruce and has signage that flashes different colors. And inside leads to a 3 floor library themed cocktail bar that's complete with crossword and book themed murals, and ""chandeliers"" made out of multiple globes.

The entire list of cocktails are twists on old classics that utilize locally sourced herbs and plants - so a martini gains arugula, and a pisco sour gains tumeric. A potentially valid argument could be that it makes this hip cocktail bar come across as being a hip juice bar. But at least the end result tastes delicious, costs the same price as the juice, and has booze in it, so that at least makes for an upgrade. In addition to the Lady Boss, I also had an incredible whiskey drink that utilized Earl Grey and ginger (The Belvedere?) that I really wish I could remember the name of, and would easily if they maintained some sort of menu that could be accessed online (hopefully this changes!). but if you don't do cocktails they also have an alright beer list, wines, and some light bites (at least from what I saw on their Facebook).

At the end of our happy hour rendezvous we were presented with paperback copy of A Street Car Named Desire (movie cover edition with a shirtless Marlon Brando on the cover for the ladies!), in lieu of the standard check holder. And even though an awkward pickup exchange managed to toss my credit card card underneath my chair when I dropped it, it was extra quirky touches which embraced their theme like that which I loved overall. And not just because it also managed to uncover a random Found letter that I'll likely be sending somewhere (http://foundmagazine.com/).

My expectations dimmed when I saw that it looked to be filled with a crowd that I don't typically relate with. And I had a hard time figuring out what was up with the surfboard table that we were seated by (and since it was on wheels I had the fight back the urge to ride it). I could also dock off some stars due to the calamari being pretty bland, and the bar deciding to randomly crank up and play some annoying DJ music over the speakers in our chill conversation room at an inconsistent point. And although I didn't go myself, I heard some real horror stories about the bathroom.

But overall there were some very good things about the place that needed to be noted and respected. Even though our group grew from a 6 people to 10 after we were seated (What can I say, McThrill knows people :D) our server hardly missed a beat and made sure that we had everything within a reasonable amount of time.

Very spacious mixed crowd where you can see everyone at the bar and plenty of TV's.

I went with the Oysters that normally are not brought in to the establisment until after 4pm but lucked out as they had these early in the day. The Oysters were quite small and not worth the price but I appreciate this bar offers them as a food option.

French Onion Soup - Pretty banging cheese. I have had better French Onion Soups but enjoyed the soup and at $8 a cup that is the max I am willing to pay.

My overall impression of this Misconduct Tavern is it is a great bar to bring friends from out of town if you want to relax and enjoy yourself spending time catching up with a great variety of food options. That being said...it is slightly overpriced but directly adjacent from The Sterling (an extremely nice apartment complex) and if you have money to rent from The Sterling I do not think you will balk at the price points. I hope this bar is around a long time as I do enjoy it however.

There other location is much more dimly lit and too crowded. Only benefit of the locust location is there are many bars you can pop in and out after visiting the locust Misconduct Tavern. The one on JFK is pretty isolated but a few minutes walk and your be back to the bar scene of the city in no time.

I was there last night with a group of seven for Yelp Eats Out and I was totally disappointed in you.  As we were leaving we discussed our # of stars and our consensus was 3. As I sit down to write this review, I could not bring myself to give you a 3. There is an old saying, ""if it's not broken, don't fix it"", Lola you are broken, now fix it.

I'm a simple man when it comes to drinks, give me vodka and I'm happy. However to night you were out of many call brands and finally had to go with a flavored one. That was okay, but how can you be out of three name brand vodkas at the same time?

My meal started out with envy, the Polenta Fries looked way better then my Calamari.  The Calamari was served cold, not luke warm, but cold. It was also flavorless. The sauce provided for dipping had a nice kick to it, just wish my Calamari was warm. 

My main entree was the Cajun Chicken breast.  The Chicken breast was sliced into four slices that were seasoned/blackened very well. The meat was also moist and tender. However, the red beans and rice were a sad mess. Those reading this review, look at the picture I posted and ask yourself, would you serve this to a guest? I've had better red beans and rice at a chain chicken joint.

Now for the Blueberry Bread Pudding, it was a total disappointment. 
I have never experienced a drier bread pudding then yours. We were actually thumping the top of it with our spoons and it sounded as if we were knocking on the front door of a friends house. As Miss Stephanie said, ""even more blueberry sauce could not help this pudding"". 

Lola, what happened? My first review was a 5 and now you are getting a 2 and a place on my No-No List. I can understand one out of my three items being off, but tonight you struck out.

They have gotten back into my good graces and I'm raising them up to 4.

Dining with a friend, we started off with two appetizers; Burnt Ends Toasted Ravs and Fried Pickles. I can now say, I've had the Ravs, but I will tell you I will not order them again. They were okay, but not worth repeating. The fried pickles on the other hand are always worth repeating, I can order them every time I come and never get tired of them. 

Being at a BBQ Bourbon place, I had to have a Manhattan. Normally I do my Manhattans up, but today I did it on the rocks. It was a nice blend of 4 Roses Small Batch, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino and Angostura Bitters. I was in heaven after a long day at work. 

I was motivated to come back for the brisket. It still impresses me that you get to select how you want it; lean, fat or burnt ends. I also like that they let you mix it up, I choose lean and burnt ends. The lean is always tender as can be, melts in your mouth and the burnt ends gives me that crusty crunch coating to the tender meat.

For sides you can never go wrong with their garlic and herb fries, or the white cheddar mac-n-cheese. On my last visit, I let our server pick my two sides. I know that is a dangerous thing to do, but I put my trust in her. I allowed her to bring me her two favorite sides and one of them I would have never ordered on my own. She brought me; Creamed Corn which turned out to be a delightful surprise. I would have liked it a little thicker, but the flavor was still a good accompaniment to the brisket. The second side was; Sweet Pepper Potato Salad. Which was rich and creamy with an extra tang from the sweet peppers.

I just don't know how I'm going to break-up with my previous love, because I'm hooked on Kounter Kulture's.

Also, the Baby Romaine Salad - I can eat this every day and not tire of it. The soft cooked egg, white anchovies and their House Miso Dressing makes for a perfect evening meal. All I have to do is uncork a bottle of white wine and I am a happy diner in my own home.

A friend and I were out running errands on a Wednesday in December and stopped by for lunch. We were seated on the back patio. I stopped to use the bathroom before joining my friend on the patio. When I entered the patio, I was hit in the face with a strong odor. The bathroom I just used smelled better then the patio. I have a sensitive nose. It didn't seem to bother my friend, so I kept it to myself, but it did effect my experience. 

We each had a draft beer to accompany our sandwiches. I had the Cheesy Bacon Burger and my friend had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Both of our sammies came with a side of fries. Both of us enjoy crinkle fries, so we were pleased that is the type Seamus serves and their position is always generous. 

My friend was pleased with her Buffalo Chicken, but my burger was not up to the level I am use to getting at Seamus. The grade of beef seemed to be different and my burger was over cooked. I also could not get beyond the odor, I should have spoken up and moved inside. 

In closing, I'll say the customer service wasn't what it normally is, but it was obvious they were short staffed, so I will not judge them on that.

The food this morning was Denny's and IHOP quality. One item had to be sent back and one item  was so bad we totally had it removed from our bill and our total bill was $70 with tip for two people. 

We arrived at the perfect time, approximately 8:30 AM, just ahead of all the Bears fans, so were seated immediately. When our server arrived, we quickly ordered a Bloody Boleyn, which is typical Bloody Mary with a champagne float on top and a MiMo which is a Mimosa layered with pomegranate juice. Both were majorly good. 
The champagne float, gave the Bloody Mary a little extra kick and flavor. 

The Biscuits and Gravy with Sausage was a vast improvement over our last visit. Enjoying today's biscuits, we realized the last time they must of made a mistake and served us the vegetarian version. This time, there was plenty of sausage floating in the thick creamy gravy. The biscuit was also an improvement, so they can go on my Biscuits and Gravy list.

Our main breakfast dishes were the Scramble with Goat Cheese, Spinach and Red Onion and the Savory Crepe, Sirloin #3. I had the Scramble. It was scrambled eggs served on top of breakfast potatoes with the before mentioned ingredients. Without the Tomato Jam that was served on the side, this dish would have been rather bland.
It was the jam, that added the pizazz. The OD (other diner) had Savory Crepe - Smoked Sirloin #3. It was a crepe filled with mushrooms, caramelized onions, asiago and of course tender sirloin. I got a bite and the horseradish sauce I dipped it had a nice bite and I am not a fan of horseradish. 

We also ordered three side dishes. The side of bacon was plentiful, done well and totally worth the $2. However, the other two sides were misses. A side of breakfast potatoes were so COLD, that we had to send them back to the kitchen. As out potatoes were going back to the kitchen, we noticed the side salad was sad and I mean real sad. The mixed greens were so wilted, that if they were at my house I would have thrown them out. Not here, they plate it and send it out to a customer. 
When our server returned with our potatoes, we just had her take the salad back and remove it from our bill. Their breakfast potatoes were a little greasy and were heavily seasoned in chili powder giving them a red tint. 

Our second round of drinks, OD stayed with the MiMo and I tried their regular House Bloody Mary. My second one was not as good as the first. Without the float of champagne, this drink seemed extremely weak. Their glasses for Bloody Mary's is large, so I think they need a little more vodka in MHO.

Gwendolyn our server needs to make a career change, she is not cut out to be a server in a high volume restaurant. She was not personable, nor attentive. Could it have been that I was wearing orange and it was the Sunday the Rams were playing the Bears. If so, you still need to provide superior service to tourist. The hostess and host seating guest were not much better.

Their long, crispy, slender seasoned fries are the perfect accompaniment to these burgers. 

I wish they offered their chicken wings during lunch, but due to their popularity and the small kitchen they do not offer them during lunch. If you want to experience the wings, be sure to arrive after 2:30PM.

Before last night when I attended the International Supper Club, I would have told you I do not like Indian food. I quickly learned  that it wasn't that I didn't like Indian cuisine, I was just eating at the wrong places. 

I will admit the service started out slow, the waiter would take half of our drink order and disappear. Then reappear with the first round and finish taking the rest of the orders.  Perhaps a dozen Yelpers could be intimidating. 

Once he started to take the food orders, a spark appeared in his personality. He truly seemed to enjoy talking about the entrees and the spice levels of each dish. He issued warnings to some diners and those who did not listen to his wisdom, had beads of sweat building up on their upper lip and forehead. 

My entree was Chicken Palak, which was chicken (given) and spinach with Indian seasonings. I was a wimp and choose my spice level as a 2 1/2. For my reentry in to Indian cuisine that was, but next time I'll be able to kick it up a notch.  The entree and rice are served in separate bowls, (almost family style) which made it easy to share samplings of other diners choices. 

Portions were large enough for take home and the other half enjoyed my experience when he got home from work. 

The ambiance is simple and casual which makes for a very relaxed dining experience.

This young foodie told me, Bonefish Grill is his favorite restaurant. With a recommendation from my bosses son, I had to give it a try.

I arrived at peak lunch time and the dining room was full. The hostess informed me I could sit at one of the communal tables in the bar and order from the same menu. I selected one that was empty, so I didn't have to share my space. My server arrived quickly and cheerfully welcomed me. I already had skimmed the drink menu and knew I wanted a Fat Tire. Their selection of beers is small, but they had an impressive martini menu. I'm going to have to return for Happy Hour to enjoy a martini. 

Wanting a quick lunch, I opted for the Fish-n-Chips and they did not disappoint. The fish was done Tempura style and the fries were crispy. I am not a fan of tartar sauce and I surprised myself by trying and actually liking theirs. I also liked that they serve ketchup in little cups, its' one of my little quirks. 

I never got to  snap a photo of their offerings of sweetness, but they have them all and deserve a spot on my Rainbow of Sweetness list. I thought it would be awkward to ask the people next to me enjoying ice tea to snap a photo of the sugar.

It was a day of shopping and bar hopping and we finished our day at Gamlin Whiskey House. We were pleasantly greeted by our bartender. As we enjoyed our cocktails his attitude got cocky, as if he were the Bees Knees.

Speaking of Bees Knees, that was one of the drinks we enjoyed and I must agree with Erin G. this is one of the best cocktails I have ever had. It's  a sweet blend of Knob Creek Rye and Ginger Ale that is served on honey laced ice. OMG, this drink is perfect for winter or summer. I can enjoy it pool side or fire side. 

However, the other drink we ordered was a major disappointment. Big Bacon Daddy, did not live up to its' description in their cocktail menu. The menu boosted bold flavors of bacon infused rye, the sweetness of maple syrup & the complexity of pomegranate shaken and served with a bacon strip garnish. This may sound good, but we found it rather blah. It was so blah, we didn't even finish it. You know a cocktail is bad when a seasoned Yelper doesn't finish their cocktail.

I had no idea that I had not updated my opinion of Adam's since my initial review. With Adam's being on Ian Froeb's Top 100 STL Restaurants for 2016, it is time to update my review. 

Numerous times when I have come for lunch, I have selected their signature smoked salami as one of my meats when doing the Pick 2 Plate. It has always been a perfect companion for my other two favorites beef brisket or turkey breast. Today I went with Ian's ""Must Order"" and enjoyed the Salami Sandwich (6 oz). 

As I order my sandwich, the cashier recommended adding brown mustard as my condiment. Being a fan of brown instead of yellow mustard, I grabbed a couple of packets to try on my sammie. For some he may be right, but not for me. I agree whole heartedly with Ian, give me a dab of Cranberry Cayenne Sauce (my favorite) and that sandwich is a winner.  I am not a fan of white bread, but it was fresh and soft. What I think would make this sandwich go over the top is a hearty beefsteak rye. I think next time I'll get mine to go and rebuild it at home. 

My two sides always seem to be the same, or at least one of them does. I love their pit beans, I think they're most likely one of the best if not the best in the local BBQ joints. Their overly creamy and sweet cole slaw has grown on me and slowly has won me over. I normally prefer an oil & vinegar cole slaw, but this one has it's merits. 

Some would say, the staff is overly friendly. I say it is southern down-home hospitality. They just want everyone to feel welcomed and they treat everyone as if they were from the immediate neighborhood. That is why Adam's is in the Top 100 Restaurants in STL - it has good food and good service.

Thankfully they had the large screen TV turned off so we could enjoy each other without that blaring away.

The lunch menu is very interesting with nice variety, and reasonable prices considering the quality of food if our dishes are any indication.

However, at $13 a dish (our lunch was not off the lunch special menu,) with no salad, no sides, just a helping of rice and a bowl of curry, we felt it was just a bit steep.

My biggest critique is that they could remove at least a couple chairs per table so you can have some more elbow room. The last time I went which was this last Friday evening, I felt cold and smushed together. I had to scoot my chair each time the servers came by with drinks. 
Also, the amount of food you get is determined by how many people sit at the table and what they order, since the cooks only come out with a set portion of rice and noodles and vegetables. I'm not sure if that applies to the chicken.

I talk myself out of going to ""expensive"" restaurants all the time for fear of having a disappointing experience. Sometimes those fears are unfounded, all too often they are not. 

The evening started out with so much promise. From the valet out front to the honest to god Maitre D' just inside, the place just screams ""old-school"" class. Frank Sinatra would have felt at home seated in a high-backed leather chair at a white linen covered table in one of their cozy oak-paneled private rooms. 

The service was top notch. Our waiter, Pee Wee, who'd been at working at the establishment ""off and on"" since 1978, was absolutely perfect. He read my wife and I completely, provided helpful suggestions, and came by only and always when needed. We weren't looked down upon or ignored because we were ordering off the ""special"" menu. 

When it comes to the food I have just two words for you: Meat. Glue. 

I am not a butcher, a chemist, or an adhesives expert, but I've worked in enough steakhouses and have seen my fair share of meat glue steaks. Go ahead and open a new browser tab and Google that if you have to/dare. It's a dirty little secret of the meat industry akin to the pink slime found in ground beef. Maybe Jimmy Kelly's chef doesn't know that he's being sold frankenfilet, or he does and doesn't care; I'm not sure which bothers me more. I halfway considered asking for steak sauce.

It didn't end there. Our baked potatoes were served still in tinfoil, and the toppings (for which we were charged an additional fee...seriously?) came in paper ramekins, a la McDonald's ketchup. The salads were bagged iceberg and the house Gorgonzola dressing was reminiscent of Kraft, or maybe, if I'm being generous, Wishbone. The corn cakes all the other reviewers rave about? Burnt. A truly disappointing meal. 

The only thing we enjoyed beyond the atmosphere, the service, and the drinks were the mushrooms and the two cobblers: blackberry and apple walnut. You're safe ordering those I'm sure --the rest? Well, you're on your own. 

In short, if you go, get something bone-in (harder to fake with meat glue), skip the potato, and soak up the classy atmosphere, the good service, and plenty of tasty tasty liquor. It will make the bill easier to stomach, especially if you're paying full price.",2013-01-18 06:54:02

Weve tried supporting them for years since we live around the corner but nothing seems to change, or better yet improve. The food is mediocre and never consistent. Wings are either soggy or under-cooked and burgers are way too pricey for the quality. So if the food isnt worth the money then why bother?

So lets examine the staff. Again, no changes here either (in years) as the attitude of not caring translates throughout the experience. Occasionally you will get a server who is friendly but Rare. Weve even tried ordering for carry out thinking at least we can just eat the food but still have to deal with someone taking an order who has no clue about the menu (not sure how thats possible) and then pickup from the bar. Bar tenders usually dont care to help once they realize your not ordering drinks. 

Salad mix is awful and dry with only brown iceburg centers.

Service was mediocre. I absolutely hate being served tea or coffee with no sugar or sweetener on the table & then have to track down the server. If the restaurant is so afraid of people stealing that stuff, then the sweetener container MUST be brought with the drinks.

The food was OK and a bit disappointing for the price (Over $100/person all in). I got the lobster bisque which received great reviews on Yelp.

I wanted to stick to the basics so I did the 3 piece with biscuit & honey butter. I had high expectations. I've had amazing fried chicken before and I was just fingers crossed on my first bite.

Looks alone, gorgeous fried chicken. The color, the specks of seasoning, the crisp and crunch of the skin, the juicy meat. Honestly, you taste the love put in this dang chicken.

The Workshop Eatery lost two stars because I had perhaps the rudest, arrogant server that I have had in the last 15 years. Right away when she came to our table I could see by her expression that wasn't enthused to serve us. We had to ask for a drink menu. I ordered a smoked grapefruit jalapeño margarita and my friend ordered sangria. Both were good. Then we asked the server  that us three would like to split some meals to try a bit of each and what would she recommend. She murmured that some of the specials were good and when I asked her to describe them, she said ""They are written on the board."" Then, when my friend asked how big the portions were because we were wondering how many to split,  she said, ""For some they feed one."" I have no idea if she was referring to our weight, or whether she didn't want to go on and describe them, but this was incredibly rude. And your job is to sell us the food, and deliver it in a pleasant manner. She did neither of these things.   So I will describe what we ordered on the menu - ARANCINI - Creamy risotto balls, lightly breaded, crispy. These were tasty. They switch daily and I have no idea what was in these because our server didn't tell us. They were executed properly. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, full of flavour.  We also ordered the crispy brussel sprouts, token steak dish, some special that now I can't remember, and two desserts. The brussel sprouts were the best that I have tasted in the city. Crispy, full of flavour and accompanied by a Sriracha sour cream. Lovely, beautiful dish. Steak was properly cooked and had more of those brussel sprouts and chirozo tater tots. Really great meal that was well balanced. However, part of our food experience was taken away from our server, we had to ask for water, we had to ask for a dessert menu, and she did not really ask us how our food was. In fact, we had to ask a server from another table to fill our glasses and ask for our bill. Will I be back? Unsure.  I am sure that if I get this server again she will spit in my food because I gave her a 1% tip. I have never ever done that and I hope that I never will do that again. So go there, but if you see a female server with a really short brown haired boyish cut, perhaps asked for a different table.",2018-02-13 16:58:08

My friends and I wanted Mexican but I didn't want to go to Las Margaritas and tried to find something not too far away but new to try. We went around 7 on a Sunday night and the main dining room seemed to be closed for the night so we sat at a high top table in the bar area. That was not a big deal however service was incredibly slow & when our waiter took our drink order he completely skipped my friends. Please keep in mind there were only 4 of us. The bar area wasn't packed but it seemed to take forever to get our meals and he completely disappeared after he dropped off the check. We seriously waited over 10 minutes for him to come back to the table. 

Once we were sat someone came out and put chips and salsa on the table. I loved this plus we all were starving! We ordered queso to go with our chips and it came out in a metal dish that they toasted in the oven. I have never seen this before and it was delicious and I would definitely order that again. I loved that they had a monthly specials menu,along with the regular menu. I decided I wanted something on the healthier side after all those chips and queso, so I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos. They were very good, I thought the shrimp were on the smaller side but none the less I really enjoyed my meal. My hubby ordered the shark meat quesadilla, he was happy with it but there was no way I was trying it. My meal came with the choice of one side and I chose the Mexican rice, i really did not like and would recommend staying away from it. It was made with brown rice and it didn't seem like it was cooked all the way.

We decided to go somewhere different and this was the perfect option this morning. Parking wasn't terrible but there is no parking lot, only street parking. They do have outside tables but the wind was terrible so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table but it seemed to go by quickly. They only have tables no booths. 

We were greeted right away and a nice big mug of fresh hot coffee while we looked at the menu. They serve both breakfast and lunch options ALL day long. So you don't have to rush to get breakfast. I love that idea! I also love that they are trying for minimal waste and conservation. I wish more places cared about the environment! 

There were so many delicious choices but I decided  to order from their specials menu & got the Spicy Bacon Avocado Benedict. It was delicious! They didn't overkill it with the hollandaise sauce and it comes with a side, you can choose from fresh fruit, rosemary potatoes or pepper and onion potatoes. I went with the pepper and onion potatoes, I'm glad I did. They had huge pieces of them with the potatoes. They weren't drenched in oil either.

Chef Paul Prudhomme was responsible (and also to blame) for the cajun blackened craze that swept the country in the 80's and 90's. I was surprised they are still so packed...we couldn't get any reservations the entire Memorial Day weekend. It was only by coming back on Memorial Day itself that we were able to score one. It was actually very nice inside, with a casual feel. Our server was nice enough I suppose, but not particularly warm and friendly. We were seated in the back, with a clear view of the kitchen. Now I know it would be too much to expect to see Chef Prudhomme still tooling away back there, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed that the Executive Chef was off that night as well.

The food was a bit of a letdown...the blackened drum (I guess they don't use redfish anymore) was tasty but kind of one-note, especially for such a huge slab of fish. It was a bit overdone, and was swimming in so much butter (and I am usually a big fan of the stuff) without any acid to cut through the fat that I felt like I needed an angioplasty after dinner. The jambalaya was another huge portion of pretty much the same taste...slightly overdone chicken, sausage, and ham. For the prices, I guess I expected a little more refinement...in essence, you are paying fine dining prices for casual/rustic food.  

The kicker was the huge cockroach lying dead on its back next to our table...no one ever bothered to get rid of it throughout our meal...not exactly an appetite enhancer. Well, I suppose we had to visit this place and now we have.",2015-08-25 17:29:09

Most takeout places have a relatively clear bland broth, but the soup broth here has substance. On the down side, the wontons are mostly skin with a pea-size amount of meat.

The sesame chicken here is made with higher quality ingredients than you would expect. It seems to be made with breast meat, while most take outs use cheaper thigh meat. In a sense that's a positive, but the distinct taste of sesame chicken is all about the dark thigh meat.

It was Saturday - I was hoping for the lunch menu but was not advised by the website that only the brunch menu would be available. Needless to say, I had my heart set on some dishes on the lunch menu so was I a tad bit disappointed from the get-go.

So, the brunch menu explicated one beer on draft for $5 (Cigar City Guayabera) which I ordered and was informed by my server that it was a typo. It's not a typo, they were clearly just out of it. I was informed that the special option was Pacifico, no thank you.  So I ordered another beer from the (oral) list that the server provided. There was no written beer menu.

The brisket was extremely juicy and tender, portion was good and flavor was terrific, the sausage is juicy but not in that fatty greasy way some places have. I like my sausage a bit on the cooked side and rely on the sauce because I hate the fat dripping from it. The pulled pork is moist and tender and has a good flavor with a touch of sweet. My oldest daughter ordered the brisket mac-N-cheese on our fist visit and they NAILED it! They have four sauces, regular and spicy that are really good and we all know how important the sauce is when it comes to a good BBQ place.

STRAWBERRY JALAPEÑO BBQ sauce is a thang!!! I was hooked on strawberry jalapeño jam a few year ago and was so excited to try a BBQ sauce like that and I was NOT disappointed. This alone is a reason to come, try or return. Just wow! 
The ribs, tough, good flavor but so tough I couldn't yank the meat off the bone with my teeth. I usually only pay to have ribs after I've had brisket at a place because it typically tells the tell if the ribs are going to be worth the money. 
Service has been good both times but I could have had two beers with my Q if the server came by a little sooner, haha! 
The prices are pretty standard given the location and who comes to the beach expecting a cheap dinner.

Because of this, my friends hate to go out to eat with me (funny, when the tab was paid for by my company, they loved it); I am constantly underwhelmed. 

So its of no surprise that my friends were frustrated with me on a random Saturday night, looking for a ""decent"" restaurant on the Hill. We actually attempted to eat at Cunetto's, but after being told there was a 2 hour wait (at 8:00pm!), we promptly left (note: I still have yet to eat at Cunetto's, so I know nothing of the food, but the smell in the restaurant was terrible.). 

We drove around the neighborhood, looking for anything that looked promising, and that's when we drove by Anthonino's.

""Stop."" 
""Why?""
""Here, we're eating here.""
""It looks like a mom and pop dive bar.""
""Its perfect."" 

Anthonino's looks like a place that serves good food. There's nothing fancy about the place--after all, cooks aren't interior designers--its just a giant room where people eat and drink. I'll take good food over ambiance any day.

Now, I must admit, I had my doubts when they dropped the menus on the table and I saw ""Greek and Italian Food."" Its normally never a good sign when a restaurant attempts two different cultures (Ever eaten sushi at a Chinese restaurant? I rest my case). But Anthonino's did a very decent job. 

Their calamari was the best I've had in St. Louis (on a follow up visit, it didn't taste as fresh, but was still better than the other sad examples of calamari I've had in this town), and the pasta dish I had, while not necessarily ""authentic,"" was delicious. Also, Anthonino's is the first place where I've actually enjoyed the toasted ravioli (every other time I've had St. Louis' famed toasted ravioli, it tasted like standard fried bar food). It was homemade! (I later learned, from a place down the street. Mama Something...)

The only problem I had was with the service. Our waitress literally came to our table a total of four times (greeting, drink order, food order and check--she didn't actually bring us anything). She didn't ask how anything was, nor did she bus our table as plates continued to pile up. My friends say its because I have a ""look,"" about me that makes people in the service industry think ""oh crap, not 'this guy,'"" but I also have crappy friends, so, whatever. 

The other thing, as noted in a prior review, is that there are a TON of kids here. I'm the type of person that likes to drink away stress, so a few Peronis, and I didn't even notice them; I suggest you do the same. 

Also, on the aforementioned second visit, a busy Friday night, I found the service to be excellent. But then again, maybe it was due to my successful attempt at appearing ""lookless.""",2008-06-09 05:10:10

I've been here a few times in the last two weeks, and every time I'm left with the same confused feeling. Luckily, their food is, overall, very good, and ridiculously cheap. The lady and I went there this past Friday, and for appetizer, salad, entrees, two cocktails and a bottle of wine, it was only $80--there are very few places in this city that you can get food that decent for that little. 

Anyway, to the confusion. 

The place overall has a very warm vibe. Lots of blacks and dark woods, balloon-like Riedel glasses, the word ""Culture"" in their tag line, and... paper napkins? Seriously, I understand what you're going for--you want to be classy, but not snooty; special, but approachable--that's great, and kudos to you for basically pulling it off, but it's off-putting to me to see not only a paper napkin on my table, but a stark white paper napkin amongst all that dark ""Culture."" It made me want to order a No. 6, super-sized. 

The service is weird because everyone is very friendly and charismatic, leaving you feeling like you've had the best service in the world. But then you notice that your water glass hasn't been filled in 30 minutes. And the last time, you had to ask, too. And you had to ask twice for a cocktail. And there's only four tables in the entire restaurant, so busyness isn't the reason. Overall, the service just isn't there. It's like they hired great people, but sub-par servers/bartenders. The only problem is, I don't know which I'd rather have if I had to choose: good person/bad server, or bad person/good server. The answer seems obvious, until you realize that you're not picking out a friend, you're wanting a good time, and you're willing to pay for it. 

I've literally tried over twelve dishes in the last two weeks (don't ask, but I told you it's one of my new faves) and there seems to be a weird pattern at West End Grill--the entrees are solid, but the sides are uninspired/unimpressive. The only exception was the bad ass brussels sprouts that accompanied the Salmon. It's not that they were bad, it's just that I expected more skill and thought in their pairings--especially after seeing exactly what they could do with their entrees. And speaking of which, West End Grill knows how to do fish. Their Salmon is awesome, and their Trout is solid. Also, I agree with everyone else on here that said the PPB&J is baller, because it is. Congratulations, you're all geniuses. 

Overall, West End is a really good restaurant that has ridiculously low prices. There are some problems with it, but nothing that can't be overlooked by one more bottle of wine. Excuse me, I said one more bottle of wine.

I can't speak to Won Ton King's standard menu, but what I can attest to is WTK's weekend ""brunch."" There's only three places (to my knowledge) that serve dim sum in St. Louis (no, that shitty excuse for a restaurant, Fu Manchu, doesn't count), and Won Ton King is by far the best. How can I tell? The fact that the place is packed out the door with Asians from 11-1 on Saturday and Sunday. Oh, and also the fact that WTK are the only ones who truly care if they serve good food. Taste the dumplings here, and then go down the street to another dim sum joint, Lulu's, and tell me its better. Once you do, I'll either call you a liar or declare your palate ignorant. Possibly both. 

Anyway, the reason why I'm uneasy in telling the STL Yelp community about this place, is because I don't need yet another of my favorite places to be overrun. Plus, if word gets out that I let the white people in the door, the other Asians will kill me...

I left here thinking I would have rather had drinks. This isn't a slight. I came during a work lunch and getting happy on frozen Pimms Cups isn't the way to go in to the second half of a work day. But I'd heard so much about them and, I'm guessing, they're relatively quick to make so both elements would have lent themselves to a good experience. But, alas, I ate here. It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that memorable. And, as I've written before, in a town like New Orleans, you have to serve memorable (hopefully in a good way) food. There's too much competition to do otherwise.

The first thing I noticed upon walking in was the brick walls. The second thing I noticed was the soundtrack. It's a good thing the walls were attractive and the tunes were bumping because I had ample time to take both in. As is mentioned in other reviews, time management issues in the kitchen is a thing here. Thankfully, before too painful of a wait, the first round of appetizers came out. Even though I hadn't gone in on the ordering, I made sure to help myself to some food.* The poutine was as good as you might imagine a French Canadian dish to be in a Cajun American city. So, good. The mac & cheese was a bit on the underwhelming side. The elbow mac was coupled with three cheeses but the consistency was more liquid than stretchy. I found it a touch off-putting. Despite my hunger, I didn't eat more than a bite. So, by the time my lunch made its way to me (I was the last served at the table), I was ready to do some damage. The chicken pesto sandwich was substantial but, ultimately, bland (chicken, pesto, minor greenery). And, dry. And, in the first world, there are few things worse than a hunk of dry chicken... especially if you're from Kentucky like I am. My side of chips were more of a forget-me-not than anything else. I appreciated the homemade quality but, it's New Orleans. Gimme some Zapp's and keep it moving.

I think I might have preferred a liquid lunch.

*A) It's how I do. B) I was looking out for all involved. No one wants to see me when hangry.",2015-10-27 19:27:38

They called me on Saturday to confirm my reservation and mentioned that they were booked up for the day and could not accommodate any time changes. Good to know!

The decor of the place is eclectic with a vintage flair- a pleasant surprise, being that the outside of the restaurant is pretty plain and industrial-looking. The kitchen is located right by the hostess stand, and since there was no wall separating it from the entry way, you could see, hear, and smell everything that was going on. Unfortunately that meant I could hear loud inappropriate conversations being had between the staff members as I waited for my boyfriend and his mom to arrive. It was a little awkward to say the least. 

When we were seated, our waiter promptly took our drink orders and went over the menu. We all ordered coffee (which tasted burnt in my opinion) and put and order of the garlic fries in. When they came out, I was excited to see that they came with 3 dipping sauces. I'm a sucker for that kind of thing! The fries were crispy and tender, nicely seasoned, and the sauces were all delicious (however, the 2 aioli sauces tasted very similar). For entrees, we ordered the crab cake Benedict, stuffed burger, and bananas foster French toast. The kitchen was nice enough to accommodate my boyfriends mom's request of a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. All of the food tasted great. 

Our waiter was very nice, but a little awkward at times. Overall, I am excited to come back and give this place a try for dinner!",2016-05-09 16:03:41

Parking is non existent so I parked in the little parking garage right next to the store it says free valet for Asian supermarket shopping. I'll get back to that later.

I was contemplating between sliced beef or brisket and after she told me the brisket had more tendon and was fattier I opted for the slice beef hand drawn noodle instead. Overall noodles were fresh and they were tasty. The broth was good but it wasn't mind blowing either. I would give it a solid 7/10. So if you're in the mood for a nice bowl of hearty Chinese soup come on in and give it a try.

Now back to the parking... I tried to finesse the Asian lady in the supermarket to validate my parking and she wasn't having it. She told me only if I spend $60 lol. So basically do not try to park there and get away with it. It cost me $11.00 to park but I'll charge that to the company so I didn't feel as bad.

- Came here on NYE, a Saturday night, winter time. 
- Party of 2.
- Restaurant has been around for 40 years.

Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to giving this place a second shot. Seems like they have their ways and are successful since they've been around for 40 years. In future visits I would be more specific about how I want my food prepared. I would also come here only under very casual circumstances...lunch, happy hour, Sunday afternoon food/beer date with friends, or if I just wanted specific seafood and was in the area. I would not celebrate any special occasions here as the atmosphere is plain. Read on for deets.

Atmosphere:
- Small restaurant. Pretty quiet. About 6-8 tables of varying size total. Orange/warm colored walls. Little to no decor.
- Very simple, ultra casual style. Good place to go if you want seafood, but don't feel like dealing with high-end prices or pretension.
- They played really romantic-ish music while we were there which was strange for the restaurant since it's very casual and it was NYE. Gave me the impression they tried to make up for the plain walls with the music.
- Quiet atmosphere. I could comfortably talk to my dinner date without yelling. 
- Because of the size of the restaurant, the 2-seater table we sat at was really awkwardly placed.
- Clean bathroom.

Food:
- I ordered 6 raw oysters as an appetizer ($9), and lobster and beef tenderloins for entree ($30). 
- The oysters were very good. In my mind, it's hard to screw up something raw! They came chilled over ice with lemon and a marinara sauce (standard). Shells about 3-3.5"" size - good size.
- The entree came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Lobster was a good size, but not tender enough. Beef was over cooked. Side vegetables were very good. Asparagus cooked right and bright green, and mashed potatoes, standard comfort food fare.

Service:
- The owner/head waitress/hostess (small place, so not sure) was very friendly. We had trouble spotting the restaurant from the street (it's very small and tucked in between a couple businesses) and called the restaurant for help. The owner saw us at the corner and navigated us to the restaurant over the phone.
- Our waiter was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed or distracted. Missed standard cues such as: introducing himself, clearing empty plates or glasses from table, didn't leave us with salt and pepper on the table (had to flag him down), served lobster without drawn butter (had to flag him down). 
- Spilled my martini on the table.
- Waiter also spilled water in front of our table and splashed us. Not too big of a deal, it was just water, but he already striked out a couple times.
- I mentioned that the beef was dry and all he did was quickly mumble, ""Sorry.""

Drinks:
- Ordered their specialty winter drink, an apple cinnamon martini ($8/9) and then a mango martini ($8/9). 
- Apple cinn drink was unique, but I wouldn't order it again.
- Mango martini tasted like it was made from actual juice. Flavor actually reminded me that of those huge cans of apricot juice. Would not order again.",2012-01-01 20:17:36

If they pumped up the serving size of the single burger by a 1/3, I'd be satisfied.

I ordered a single smokeshack burger (bacon) $6.69, cheese fries $3.95, and a beer $4 (on sale from $5.50 by the way!), and this cost me $15 and change. The invisible reason for the cost of the burger is the meat is Angus beef with no hormones or antibiotics. 

If you come here in a family setting, this can very quickly add up. For a family of 4 if  each person ordered the same thing as I did, it would result in a $60 meal at a fast casual burger joint. I don't feel this is really value-added considering this is upscale fast food, there are no left-overs and this cost doesn't even include dessert. By the way, that assumes single burger. For a smokeshack double it's $9.49. I'm not sure why a slice of bacon warrants $1.50 extra from the $7.99 regular double cheeseburger.

The atmosphere here is nice and industrial/modern style. They have wood top tables that have been converted from old bowling alleys. There's a handful of TVs hanging around. There are tables (2-4 seaters), booths, and a faux-bar area which could seat 12 in a square-shaped table.

They offer a different ice cream custard flavor each week. it can be ordered straight or mixed in with some other sweets. Their chocolate sprinkles are unlike any I've ever had. They're super fragile and tiny, just a quarter the size of a regular chocolate sprinkle. I find their custards to be too sweet and amplified for my taste, but the flavors are unconventional like jelly donut and pineapple upside down cake. In each city that they operate, they offer a ""local"" something dessert. Like in this PA location, they have a Valley Forge Freeze, and a Liberty Shell. 

The service here is hit or miss. Sometimes the employees act like they want to be there, other times, I find they could care less and I feel like I am an inconvenience. Upon ordering, you get a buzzer, and it'll go off when your food is ready. The dining area is also hit or miss. When they are packed around the usual dining times, there are no tables and whatever table there is, you need to flag someone down to wipe it. Note that one nice, full-service-esque thing they do is come around and take away your trash and trays.

I'm glad there's one in the KoP scene, but I do believe they are pricey for what they offer - a glorified burger joint. They do give Elevation Burger, Five Guys, and Smashburger a run for their money, but for the cost, I'd rather pick up some high quality ground beef and pop 'em on my Weber!",2015-04-12 15:03:14

They lose my business each time they tell me to come to the walk up because I am in a hurry and on my lunch break. It is INCONVENIENT to park, walk up, and order when I could have just done the exact same thing from the safety of my car. Now you want me to walk up and be surrounded by people standing in front of your restaurant just because you can't take an order through the intercom? RIDICULOUS!!!! THERE IS A PANDEMIC GOING ON WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE. Smh... I've never been to a Rally's as bad as this one. Negative stars...",2020-08-04 16:22:38

We ordered pizza and their newer offering, a ""pot of meatballs"" which comes with focaccia.  We did ask specifically for the focaccia to go along with the meatballs.   When we got home, the focaccia was not there.  By the way, they usually all give you a scoop of ricotta cheese when you order the meatballs as side orders.  This also was not given with the pot if meatballs. 

The issue is the response when I called back to let them know.  I spoke with a Whitney who was the manager.   She was apathetic at best.   Certainly, the customer service aspect of things was less than acceptable to me.  The food here is really good and we will go back.   I will make sure Whitney knows how she could have handled things to make things right.

No, I'm not proud of this, but there's nothing wrong with making an honest wage. Occasionally I'll get a hankering for something from Applebee's - and no, I don't have to use my Yelp application to find one :)

Last Friday night I was really craving mashed potatoes. Applebee's does make a mean mashed potato. And nothing else would suffice. Called in a Carside To-Go order and was out the door in minutes. Pulled up to the reserved Carside parking and a bubbly young lady was ready to greet me within seconds. As I pulled out of the lot, I thought to myself, ""Why the heck don't I eat here more? This is so great.""

And that's where the good times stopped rolling...

Got home and unpacked my order, only to find that the bubbly young girl (hint: bubbly = not very smart!) put fries in my to-go box instead of mashed potatoes. Normally I'm not picky about my taters, but the only reason I ordered Applebee's was to get the mashed potatoes. 

Mistakes happen, right? No big deal! I called up to tell them about the error - she was very apologetic and asked that I come back for my potatoes and a dessert.

Get back in the car, drive back to the Applebee's and wait. When she comes back out to the car, I hand her the bag of food, untouched. She looks confused: ""I thought you only wanted mashed potatoes. You want an entirely new meal?"" 

Well, by the time I've driven back and forth, it's been a good 30 minutes and my food is now cold. 'Aint no way I'm taking home warm mashed potatoes and cold fried shrimp! She looks very irritated and confused... ""But I brought you dessert,"" she says.

I don't give a crap about the Duncan Hines creation that she carefully wrapped in aluminum foil at this point. I want the warm meal that I ordered. 30 minutes ago! That I've now driven waaaaay too much to eat!

Eventually I got my meal the way I wanted it. And I certainly didn't meant to frustrate or confuse the Carside To-Go girl (whom I tipped very well, btw). But it just goes to show you that places like Applebee's don't take the time or energy to train their employees (myself included!) properly. Or hire people with common sense!

I like mine a little smokier but I am heavy on the smoke when I do my own. I think most people will like the level of smoke flavor though. The sauce tastes like it's bottled or something, kind of non-descript. The slaw is plain and not very tasty. The garlic mash potatoes were really good. TONS of garlic! The pulled pork and the ribs were way too salty for my taste but I don't really care for salt. Even though, I think most would call this too salty. Maybe they were just a little heavy handed with the rub that day because no other reviews mentioned salt. The brisket was moist and tender. Way better than I have ever made it.

A place to get either a full, inexpensive good meal or just a cup of coffee while checking mail/social media. Wi-Fi here is fast and reliable.  This Chick-Fil-A location has fit the bill for me these last 3 weeks and will continue until April 2016 as his PT continues.
As you enter the complex in which it is located you are pleasantly surprised to find plenty of parking. Inside, the place is just too cute!    Clean, bright and uncluttered. There are 2 real carnations in vases on every table.  You won't find any trash cans here because as soon as someone exits a booth or table it is cleared by CFA staff.
 Parents/Grandparents will be happy to see a clean, nicely lit, enclosed play area with seating outside the glass enclosure so you can feel like you are part of their play. And the kids do because they are always opening the door and interacting with the adults who have brought them here. It's really a nice family space.
Food: For fast food it is great. And they have healthy options. I noticed the kid's meals can include a fruit cup and milk. Great news for parents.
For me, I just try something different every visit. I love the healthier options here; particularly their Yogurt parfait and their salads.   But for those times when you just want something other than the salad you must try the Frosted Lemonade- Summer in a cup !

Never mind that, the food was very good. We split two orders of the vegetarian rolls (3 per order). Two of us ordered the Pad Thai; the other two ordered clay pot soups. One soup was Green Curry Seafood Soup in clay pot (very spicy) and served with rice. She loved it. 

I am blanking on the other soup.  It was in a clay pot and was more tomato based and not served with nice, nor was it as spicy. She also enjoyed her lunch immensely.

The Pad Thai was listed as spicy so we both requested the dish with less spice. The restaurant happily obliged. The dish did skimp on the shrimp (only 4, and tiny), but was generous with the tofu and sprouts. It had good flavor, but I picked up a strong syrupy sweetness at the end. Next time, I would request the sweet to be scaled down too. 

Lunch for the four of us ran $54 before tip. Not too bad but slightly more expensive than other Chinatown spots.

$16 Bottomless was the only positive positive about this experience. You can switch it up and choose from mimosas, peach bellinis, kir royals, poinsettias. Good deal considering one single peach Bellini is $11. 

Belgian waffles- $18 - 3 tiny and dry waffles with some fruits and maple syrup. Could've probably made the same waffles and I don't even know how to cook.
Cheesesteak omelette - $19 - probably the only thing we all were ok with. The beef short rib was skimp. I think the only thing good anyone said about the entrees was that the omelette was good, which speaks a lot about the experience. 
Turkey BLT Panini- $17- for $17 I can guarantee you getting 3 Wawa Sandwiches is more worth your money and it'll taste better. Sandwich was really dry, everything kept falling apart. I love paninis and this was an insult to the panini name.
Surf and Turf - $22 - 3 pieces of shrimp, giant chunk of iceberg lettuce and some thin pieces of ""filet,"" so thin it couldn't be cooked medium rare and was mostly well done.
Steak and Eggs special - $27(?)- 7oz ribeye with scrambled eggs. 75% of the ribeye was all fat and 75% was alive, we asked for medium rare and got rare. 
Seasonal fruits- $5- for a teacup of like 2 strawberries, 2 pieces of pineapple, and 8 blueberries.
Chocolate cake-$12- this was good! Layers of fudge cake, vanilla cheesecake, and chocolate cream was delicious.
Creme brûlée- $10- really basic and nothing special. Whole Foods creme brûlée tastes better than this. 
Espresso- $4- I used to be a barista in college, this was like half an espresso. 
Cappuccino -$5- nothing special super tiny.

Service- 2/5 - server was unfriendly. She kept bringing out 5 sharing plates/utensils/etc even though it was a table of 6, and we had to keep grabbing things from the table next to us...It was my friends bday (it even said it on the reservation) and she had birthday balloons and there wasn't even 1 candle on the 2 desserts we ordered! Another server (might have been the manager) who made conversation with us a few times asked why we didn't sing hpbd, told him we didn't get a candle. Saw him talk to our server while pointing at our table, we thought some kind of accommodation was going to be made for my friends bday but the server brought out the check.

We used a yelp check in and got one of the desserts for free. We sat outdoor on the mid deck but it was windy so there were clear plastic covers over the deck.

They both give eggrolls and I liked both the same amount. However, I prefer the sauce at Simply. Pockets is sweeter and bright orange. It's flavorful, but there was something more savory in Simply's sauce.

The salmon rolls had too much rice and the seaweed was too thick.  We slathered the rolls in soy sauce and wasabi to make them more palatable. 

Ordered three pieces of sushi.  They were some of the largest pieces of sushi I've ever had. The salmon was not fresh.  The hamachi was boring.  The striped bass, which was the cheapest of the sushis, was actually the most flavorful. 

A crisp Riesling is usually a good accompaniment to sushi.  Unfortunately, there is not one on the menu.  The one they had was cloyingly sweet, with no acid or fruit.  It wasn't even finished!  The pinot noir was too earthy.  The cava, while not great, was the best of the options.

I checked in on Yelp and got a free beer or wine! What a glorious surprise!

Service was fine with Phillip. Although it did drag and drag and drag. Maybe they're used to leisurely lunches, but we didn't want it to take the entire afternoon.

We both got sandwiches. They come with a choice of house-made chips or fries.

My girlfriend got the Vegetable Burger with eggplant condiment, cheddar and arugula on a wheat bun. She opted for the house-made chips.

I got the fluke sandwich ($12) -- With bibb lettuce, olives, capers, tomato and aioli on a wheat bun. I opted for the fries.

It was nice that we were given a vessel of water, but we drank it all up, and it wasn't replenished. So I was going dry.

She said her burger was OK. I tried a couple of the house-made chips, and they were OK.

The fluke was good. I ditched the bun and found wonderful flavors. The bibb got a little wilty, but that happens.

The olives were huge green olives. The capers were reasonably abundant. The tomatoes were cherry or grape or heirloom, and held up well. The aioli was a nice condiment.

The fries were well-seasoned. Something on them. I'm guessing it was Parmesan.

We left asking for elevator service up, and were beautifully escorted to the upper regions by a lovely employee who accommodated us and was incredibly gracious. And we saw the backside of the kitchen doing this.

I had a hefty recyclable to-go vessel of half the fluke and some of the fries.

-1 for the stairs, which could be incredibly treacherous for many people
-1 for the dreary pace of the meal
-1 that our water vessel wasn't replenished
+1 for the Yelp check-in free beverage
+1 for the escort to the elevators

I don't recall this option from our previous visit, but there are two sizes of salad. Everybody got a small for $6. The large is $9.

Each pair split a large thin-crust pizza. All pizzas were $20.

Two full Lincoln Park - mozzarella, garlic olive oil, zucchini, fresh tomatoes, feta and fresh basil.

My splitting partner got the Berkeley -- mozzarella, portobella, onions, kalamata olives, red bell peppers, garlic and zucchini. I got the North Beach Classico -- mozzarella, Berkshire sausage, mushrooms, onions and green bell pepper.

I always forget that any deep-dish ingredients can be made into a thin-crust pizza, and any thin-crust ingredients can be made into a deep-dish pizza. Great versatility, but more options if you have trouble choosing!

All pizzas were thoroughly enjoyed. All ingredients looked truly fresh. And the crust was crunchy and tasty. The Berkshire sausage on my pizza was so flavorful. Everybody ate their pizza with a knife and fork.

Two of us ordered Diet Coke, and our server didn't tell us they carry Pepsi products. Well, it was OK with me, but the other person detests Diet Pepsi, so her beverage had to be changed out.

We got a basket of rolls (We had to ask for the rolls, after we saw other tables getting rolls.), and they were absolutely fantastic. There were yeasty, hot pretzel rolls topped with pretzel salt; and hot, herb rolls -- served with REAL butter.

Two of our group got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich ($9) -- battered chicken breast, hot sauce, ranch, lettuce and tomato on brioche. They both chose fries as the side. This was A LOT of food! The chicken breast was huge, and the breading was also buffaloed, but not too heavily.

I got the French Dip ($9) -- roast beef covered with four-cheese gratin on French bread with au jus.

I've never had a French Dip before, and this was tasty. Still, I don't quite get why you would want to put bread in juice and sog it all up. But I did it, and the juice was good! The four-cheese gratin didn't add any flavor.

I got cottage cheese as my side, but couldn't help myself and ordered fries, too. Our server described them so beautifully.

The dollar burger menu encourages you to order a basket of fries or tots. Ask how much that costs -- 'cause it ain't $1. We asked. And we asked how many that basket would serve.

OK, here's the rundown: one basket of fries or tots costs $4, and it serves 2-3. BINGO! You got the picture.

We started out with a cone basket of calamari with its lucious ketchup-horseradish sauce. It was wonderful. I wish we'd ordered two.

Then we were on to the burgers. Everybody got exactly what they ordered, brought out by the ""kitchen""? Not sure, but he was fabulous. And we got a basket of tots.

By this time our sixth attendee had arrived, and she was giving her burger order to the kitchen guy. He was taking it all in, but then Susie was there, so she took over. Great service!!

And we ordered another basket of tots. There's just something about tots that reminds me of childhood. And, yes, tater tots were already invented when I was a child. (So was fire.)

The burgers just hit the spot! Great buns, a good-sized patty with nice beef flavor and a reasonable amount of lettuce. Add a little ketchup and a lot of mustard (both free), dig into the tots, and you gotta a great meal! I added Cheddar to my burger, so it was a $1.50 burger. There were four cheese options: Cheddar, Pepper Jack, American and Provel (I think).

That second basket of tots was HOT-HOT -- fresh out of the tot-maker!! Yum!! The six of us did not finish that second basket.

The servers were all staring at our party and laughing while rolling their eyes. The rest of the evening was extremely uncomfortable because we were the last in the shop to be served. When we walked up to see the cake selections another sever (not sure of her name but she had blonde hair and black glasses on) was talking to another male about our party and how ""annoying"" our party was. To add insult to injury, the hostess Ellie, continued to talk about the clients in the shop and our party the rest of the evening with the other staff. It felt more like a gossip session than a relaxing evening out. I find this kind of service extremely upsetting especially after we have heard such great things about this shop. Needless to say I don't think we will be returning to this location due to the way we were treated on our first visit. I've always highly recommended this place to people visiting Indianapolis based of off reviews but sadly can no longer do that.

About the service: SLOW. Meaning: we waited 20 minutes to order food...as did the other 2 tables in our room. One table asked each other, ""What are we doing here? Eating? Let's leave the waitress seems to have forgotten."" The waitress, who was very nice, apologized as they left and promptly took the orders of the 1 remaining table and us.

We all got soup and/or salad at the table so should not have taken very long to serve.  The restaurant is also very loud since all the TVs were going and there was a descent crowd for lunch.

The upstairs bathroom I went to had no hand soap left. 

We went for a dinner date and got the following:
Butter rolls
Small oyster plate 
Some kind of filet mignon/beef dish 
Lobster mac and cheese 
3 cocktails  

The bill was fairly high at almost $200, and while the food was good for the most part, it wasn't overwhelming. The lobster mac and cheese didn't have much lobster in it, but my partner really enjoyed his steak. 

A huge issue I had was we were placed in a room where the wait staff kept opening the door to serve people sitting outside- on a night where it was around 40 degrees Fahrenheit. A couple of people complained yet they kept leaving the door open and that did not make for a pleasant indoor experience to have to sit through a very frigid breeze while eating.

Another issue was our waitress who informed my partner on his way to the bathroom that I was ordering a cocktail, as if I was ordering behind his back, although I was the one paying the bill. This was extremely unprofessional of her, and neither he or I appreciated this.

Overall, it was pleasant enough despite the tacky and multivariate decor, but I'm not sure it was good enough to match the prices and that we would go back.",2020-11-19 18:25:36

The Crostini was FLAWLESS, and the Angry Orchard Beer was AWESOME.

Del Fresco Grille.

The restaurant looks great, I love the feel of it, sophisticated but relaxed. 
Service from our waitress from spot-on, she was efficient, chatty but not overbearing, knowledgable and free with her answers. 

The menu was interesting without a lot of filler or randomness to it.  I could appreciate the more simplistic dishes and even the items that were a bit more complicated made sense. 

We had the Guacamole - Hand-Mashed Avocado, Crisp Corn Tortilla Chips. Kale & Brussels sprout Salad w/chicken - Roasted Almonds, Dried Cranberries, Orange Segments, Shaved Manchego, Creole Mustard Vinaigrette along with Grille Prime Cheeseburger - Doubled-Stacked USDA Prime Beef Patties, American Cheese, Lettuce, Red Onion, Sloppy Sauce, Tomato, Pickle.

The presentation was awesome, the salad was honestly gorgeous. I was almost excited to eat it!

The guacamole was ice cold with large chunks of avocado. Which I was pleased with, I don't like my guac to be totally smashed. It would be nice if the chips were a bit more hardy, they kept breaking. Sadly, the guac was bland, very bland and it tasted of nothing.

I brushed it off and called it a one-off, we continued with our meal 

As I said when I saw the salad I was excited but sadly the salad offered more of the same bland taste of the guacamole. Which was incredibly surprising given the ingredients.  I was expecting SO much more in flavor.

However, the food was incredibly bland. I have high blood so I'm aware of my salt intake and I normally do not cook with salt if I do, I use very little.  

SO was equally unimpressed with his food selection as well.  I'm not sure if it was just a bad evening for them or.....but I was not impressed.",2019-03-06 15:45:01

Finally a gentleman came out and asked me what I wanted. I had a few questions about the chicken kabob, thighs/breast? He didn't know so I went with something I've never had, fish kabobs. My order was to go and it was a 15 minute wait.

When I think kabobs I think meat on a stick. That wasn't the case for the fish, no biggie. The fish had amazing flavor, packed the punch I adore from Indian cuisine but it was dry. I should've ordered a condiment/sauce to help that situation. I was also thrown off off by the skin still being on. Lastly, the rice was my favorite part of the meal!!

This is bothering me about the chicken wings because I had told my aunt about this place at because my uncle loves ribs but I'm fortunately it wasn't a great place to celebrate we shoulda went to a sit down restaurant but everybody had just got off of work we just wanted to grab something and go home and celebrate but I will think the next time and hopefully I won't be back there to get no chicken wings if I go back it would just be for the ribs only ribs they cook them the day early and then wrap them in for you and no telling how long the food really was sitting there it could have been sitting from yesterday if they didn't sell out. And on 8 21 2014 I called the restaurant and spoke to the same lady did not wash her hands and to let her know about the Wingdings was very dry and all she said was is nothing she can do about it she will head the tub chill pass it on to the manager but again is nothing she can do about it and then put the wings in a rotisserie and also informed her that yes I know but those wings should have not been dry out and she did not take my name no number to the manager and call me back  they need good customer service or the business would crumble.

I also visited NYC to try out the original Halal Guys. So coming here, I didn't know what to expect. However, the high reviews and long lines at the grand opening surely heightened my expectations.

Pros:
1. The location is in Chinatown. Accessible and around a lot of surrounding places/dessert areas.

2. Tremendous customer service. Quick, friendly, and attentive to give you extra sauce throughout your meal if you're eating there. Everyone is always smiling.

3. Healthier than food truck. You can tell that the meat is better quality, the veggies are fresh cut, and the sauce portions are not as extreme. (But I must say, the sauce is what defines the taste. I always get extra sauce...and then extra extra sauce!)

Cons:
1. The quality is actually just pretty hyped up. The meat tastes a bit dry and they give way too much rice for my liking. The rice doesn't have much taste which ends up making me want to drown it in more sauce. In the end, I'm just eating straight up white sauce and rice. 

2. The seating here is sparse. There's 3 small tables outside which is really underprepared in my opinion. If you know that this is going to be a busy chain in such a populated area, why only have 3 tables? There's a high chance you'll stand eating or stay on-guard for a free table for the entity of your meal. I understand that China Square is still not open entirely and the space is tiny (there may be a chance they want to imitate the grab-n-go mentality of the original food truck), but still. 

3. The price. For a small bowl ($7.99) or a large bowl ($8.99), you get healthy halal, but it just goes back to my con #1. Tiny meat and veggie portions, and just heaps of rice and sauce. It doesn't even come with a drink! So you end up paying $2 more for a fountain soda. 

All in all, I personally prefer food truck halal. It's cheaper (considering the portion size and the drink included). It tastes better because the sauce-meat-veggie-rice portion is balanced out. I find myself drizzling more and more sauce every time I come to his Halal Guys location! The calories! The overkill on rice just ruins it all. Although it's unhealthier because of the grease, it fills me up and I stay under a budget. 

Lastly, I don't know if this is still an issue, but I couldn't order a drink when I tried to order from this location on UberEATS. They said they didn't have bottled drinks, but they could've just given me a fountain in a to-go cup like most places would do.",2017-01-16 04:57:26

We shared the artichoke shrimp dip and it was amazing. I'm usually skeptical about mixing shrimp with a cream based dish, but it was a pleasant surprise. Next I had the ""Trash"" bucket, which included fried fish, shrimp, fries, and crab legs. That was no disappointment. The batter used was light and seasoned with great flavors.

Now, it was pretty busy on a Wednesday night with a 10-15 minute wait.  Not a big deal.  There was a special on fajitas being two for the price of one.  It sounded good, so my pal and myself were curious to see how everything was.  Our server was very nice but clearly a bit harried, and was kind enough when we mentioned being interested in beer to tell us that if we ordered RIGHT THEN, we could take advantage of the happy hour.  We appreciated that, placed our order of steak and shrimp fajitas along with an order of cheesy shrimp appetizer and waited.

She came by first to let us know that they were busy, but that the cheesy shrimp should be up soon.  Then, after over 20 minutes she swung by and told us that unfortunately our appetizer order had been placed, but picked up by a different server for another table and offered us a salad while we were waiting for the next order to be ready.  Not really what either of us wanted, but we wanted to be understanding.  Our server, still trying very hard to be nice (and it was appreciated) but still clearly busy came by already stirring up our salad with the dressing included.  Doled out a portion for both of us and was off like a shot.  I take a sniff and ask my pal, ""... it's ranch dressing, isn't it?""  He confirmed, and I dumped my salad back into the bowl.  We weren't even asked what dressing to have, but ranch and blue cheese are pretty much the two I can't stand personally.

The cheesy shrimp finally comes out, and it's hot but tasty.  It used real butter, which was appreciated.  However, the serving plate is deceptive as it only really houses six medium sized shrimp in tiny indentions.  When we finished, our fajita plates came out.  My friend didn't have a SINGLE green pepper in his and only one slim sliver of red pepper.  I didn't have any red pepper at all, and I counted a whole of four small-ish sized shrimps in total.  Between us, we were only offered five taco sized tortillas.  Yes, I know we could've asked for more... but really, with how hectic everything was, our food might've gotten cold before they were brought out.  Everything was good enough, and the deal was a solid deal, but the steak of our fajitas were definitely on the chewy side.

At the end of it all, our server could tell that our experience wasn't the best, and had the manager comp our appetizer.  Which was appreciated... but there was enough going wrong through the experience that I can't give a good rating.  I'll probably give them another chance some time and hope this was simply a fluke on a busy night, but you have to wonder... this was a Wednesday night.

Our waitress was very attentive and helped us pick out food in the beginning but as other tables started to fill up I could feel our service getting slower and slower. But given that there were 11 people in my party and it was clearly a busy day for them, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. Overall it wasn't too bad!
Finally, the food. I wish I had pictures but our table ate everything too quickly. The meatballs and garlic bread were AMAZING. The pasta bolognese and the signore bianco were also super tasty. I didn't feel too strongly about the ricotta gnocchi or the bluecrab risotto, but I believe the risotto is one of their most popular dishes.
Overall, they get 4 stars for the slightly slow service and the fact that our dishes seemed to get less tasty as the courses progressed. But I will definitely be back!",2020-01-22 19:24:59

I hadn't been to IHOP for around a year so I thought I would give it a try.  The small parking lot that is shared with other stores, but I felt fortunate to find a space.  Something is going on with Brandon, as the traffic was horrendous getting there, so I was hoping there wasn't a line.  I lucked out as the restaurant was pretty full and a waiting list did form after I was seated.
 
My prior experiences at IHOP were fairly mediocre, but today I had not complaint.  Duane my server came over to take my drink order as soon as I sat, coffee, orange juice, and water.  I always ask for a glass of water as a back up plan, since I have had too many experiences at various restaurants sitting for ages waiting for my coffee,soft drink, or water to be refilled.  The drinks were delivered to the table in less than 3 minutes.
 
This morning I ordered off of the 55+ menu the 2x2x2, which in my case consisted of scrambled eggs, sausage links, and pancakes.  The order arrived very hot in about 5 minutes.  The scrambled eggs were done as I liked them, not over or under cooked.  The pancakes were done perfectly, light and fluffy.  You wouldn't think it would be hard to make pancakes, but I can't count the times at other restaurants where my pancake were burnt on one side (always the side facing down like they are hoping you won't notice).
 
In summary, the place was clean, crowded but not too noisy.  The service and food were above average for a restaurant chain.  In my mind 3 stars is very good for this type of establishment (I might give 5 stars for Sunday Brunch at Oystercatchers, but then again that's 6x the price).",2018-05-05 16:50:02

I don't know how many times we've been here, maybe about 6 or 7 times. 

Each and every time we've had shitty service and bad food. I don't think I've ever had fresh french fries there. Each and every time they've been soggy. If I had to hesitate a guess it would be that they scoop the fries that are getting older out of the bin into the containers and putting them aside before they dump the new batch in that then sits there until the old, packed containers go out, repeat. 

Same thing with the burgers. I'm not making it up, half the time I've been there I've had dry, stale burgers buns, twice to the point where they were inedible. I mean hard and stale. I don't know what's so difficult about pulling buns out of package, processing them, making burgers, and sending them across the chute. 

Then! To top it off, you can't order anything special order. It just gets messed up. ""McDouble, no ketchup, no mustard, add lettuce."" That's it. Never have they gotten that correct. 

Lastly, I go there normally around peak time. So it's not 1/2 before they close, it's not dead of the afternoon when they hardly have any drive-thrus going through. 

There's a reason for the lack of cars at the drive thru. There's a reason this location pretty much only gets one star from everybody.

Just pick another location.",2021-02-10 22:43:37

When you walk into the place you get full-on 80s vibe. From the (lack of)  decor to the carpet to the buckled and stained ceiling tiles. I was totally expecting to see CRT TV/VHS combos on the walls and was pleasantly surprised to see that they had upgraded to horrible picture quality flat screens. Bonus.

It was extremely apparent that the owners put $0 back into their business. Not to make it look better, not to upgrade it, not to clean the place up.

We came in on a whim because we'd passed this place many times and figured we'd give it a go. 

We found a booth and sat while we looked over the menu.

Y'all....everything was sticky. And by ""everything"" I mean *everything*. Menus, table, parmesan/chili flakes/salt shakers, everything. That place needs to shut down for a long weekend so they can power wash everything. They should just rent three power washers and go from ceiling down to the floor with everything piled in a big mound in the middle with a clorox bleach and water combination. 

When I went up to order the employee said nothing. I mean nothing. Just stood there with a pen and pad. So I ordered pan crust, bacon and mushroom, two drinks. I got an answer back of ""is that all"". I said it was, the order got rung up, and the nice young man just outstretched his hand for my card, not a peep out of him, and the transaction was completed. 

I took our two cups and got drinks from the fountain. Then sat down.

And waited.

The place was as loud as you'd imagine a small room to be with ten 8 year olds running around unattended. Another reviewer said it best, though she meant it as a compliment: ""There is just enough background noise to drown out any racket your own child might be making."" I shit you not, that is actually in a five star review.

While we waited we (honestly) sprayed down the entire table and all the shakers with hand sanitizing spray.

When the pan crust pizza came to the table we didn't know what to say. We just sat in awe at this sorry excuse of a pizza. It got worse.

Please, I beg you, look at the pictures. 

What they call ""pan crust"" is regular thin crust stretched up about 1/2 - 1"" up the sides of the pan. The crust was thin, flabby, and barely browned. Again, look at the pictures, I'm not making this shit up. It gets worse.

The bacon was bacon bits. The mushrooms were jarred/canned mushrooms. 

I don't even know how to properly describe this thing.

The only redeeming factor with the entire pizza is that it was cut into about 26 slices. I know they do that because this ""restaurant"" is meant for patrons that are 8 years old and younger. So that's awesome.

THEN.....oh!...THEN as we were walking out leaving 3/4 of a pizza sitting on the table we got a glance of the ""salad bar"". Bahahahahahaha!! Again, see the pictures. It was so abysmal we both laughed as we walked out the door. 

If you are looking for a place to have a birthday ""party"" for your 6 year old and don't want to spend the money on chuck e cheese and want to give your guests of how it felt going out to a somewhat shitty family restaurant in the 80s then this is definitely the place for you.  

If you are looking to be ignore by employees and feel unappreciated this is the place for you.

If you are looking for extremely sub-par food at regular prices then this, also, is the place for you.

I don't....I just don't.

Don't go. Just don't go. It's not worth it. Do yourself a favour and opt to upgrade to McD drive thru and eat in the parking lot with folding tables and balloons.",2021-08-13 18:58:50

Are they under new ownership? Didn't recognize the lady working there. What happened to the Asian couple?

I came here at 9:00 a.m. and they hardly had any in their case to sell. Donut holes, lots of glazed, two chocolate frosted, a smattering of a few things. All could fit on three trays. This is 9:00 a.m. and hardly any inventory? Shame. I was going to get a dozen to take home to the family. Change plans.

I got a glazed and a chocolate donut. I took a bite of the glazed. One bite. ""What's going on here?"" No fluffy texture like it used to be. Slightly doughy. Took a bite out of the chocolate frosted.

I had to get the menu back and show him.  I asked for mine to be cooked between medium & medium well (Ruth Chris calls it medium plus).  The waiter had a hard time with it...  It ended up coming out more like medium rare.  No pink at all it was pure red.  They took it back to cook it more and what a disaster.  It was overlooked.  All brown.  More like well done.  Very dry and no seasoning whatsoever.  I only ate a few bites.  My scalloped potatoes were dry and not good.  After we were done our waiter came by and said he would bring our check.

We did not have a reservation and walked in. There were a few tables open with dirty dishes on them, but the rest of the place was full.

We chatted for a bit and found out that they were going up to the bar to order drinks for the lack of service. At this point we opted to leave and get dinner elsewhere. The third visit was for happy hour. It is not the best deal in town, but they do have a couple of good things included on the happy hour specials. The bartender was chatty and a good time, but you could see the frustration with the lack of ingredients he had on hand. Fortunately we stuck to wine by the glass. The hot food at this visit was really tasty, but the same could not be said for the raw bar.

Went their with much anticipation for a business dinner.  Started with the 1/2 pound crab cake.  Good to very good.  $5 or $6 splitting charge, server did not know.  Are they kidding on a $14 appetizer?  Mentally both of us checked out after the whole big deal about the sharing charge.  And getting a second plate to do it ourselves took some asking.

Caesar salads, small but good.  Main courses well prepared and generous.  If I were to return found all kinds of interesting options to explore.

Got very weird again at the end, the server spent all kinds of time trying to get us to sign up for their email list and to download their app.  Told us all about the coupons and free stuff we would get.  We declined and then asked for seconds on the espresso.  They took our check back and revised it.  Again, their choice.  We did buy $70 bottle of wine, didn't seem to matter.

I understand they are busy and trying to cram as many people as possible, but I was stacking items on our table to have enough room for my plate.  

Jason ordered the chicken fried steak and I had their California Benedict.  Jason was fairly happy with his meal, although the coffee was really watered down. I've had the California Benedict at the South Reno location, but here it just wasn't good at all.  The toast was burnt to a crisp which made it impossible to cut without a steak knife.

Their coffee is sourced from Ethos and was great. 

We ordered a stack of pancakes and a vegetarian omelet with hash browns. To be honest, it was just an a-ok breakfast. The portions were decent and food was delivered in a timely manner, but it was just ok. To be fair, I like things flavorful so I would have loved some additional spice on the hash browns, but I know that's not everybody's thing. I ordered some of their homemade hot sauce to spice things up, and it was ok. 

Service was very friendly and nice and I love to support local businesses, so we'll be back for breakfast one of these days.

Yes, the samurai in the lavatory is still the coolest thing we've seen in a public bathroom, and the flat granite slab that serves as a co-ed sink is someday going to grace our home, but ambience isn't what we come for, we come for food.

The hot kitchen has suffered recently and that's been reflected in a menu that has dropped to a quarter the size it once was. The short lived tempura menu is no longer offered, a shame as the tempura was some of the best we'd tasted. 

The Sake menu has also started to suffer due to supplier issues, with some of our favorite sake's no longer available. There are still some great offerings (try the black bottle) but it's always a disappointment when your old 'standards' go by the wayside.

Luckily, there's Chef Sam.

Chef Sam will be the only reason this place pulls through from the gutting of the hot menu. His skill with sushi is amazing and on this visit we tried his interpretation of Beef Negemaki, which was delicious. The bartender that evening, Chris (one of our favorites so tip him well) suggested it be served with a small portion of rice and I agree, it would be perfect with the delicious sauce.

Sam's sushi is always delicious. Check with him to see what he's brought in fresh the day you go. White Tiger is delicious though a tad spicy for me, but Sam is always happy to cut back on the spice when requested to.

If Sam's not there on the night you go, we suggest you come back another day.

We'll be trying this place every so often to see what happens as Sam takes the reigns of the hot kitchen and the place gets it's feet back.

My boyfriend and I both have allergies (me to peanuts, him to both peanuts and shrimp), so we're pretty careful when we go out to eat and read the menu thoroughly. After we both ordered the brisket ramen, our server was chatting with us about a customer who had an allergic reaction after eating the brisket ramen because of the shrimp it contains. We were obviously alarmed because nowhere on the menu was it listed that there was shrimp in the brisket ramen. Luckily, we were able to change my boyfriend's order before he ate it. I just thought it was strange because shrimp is such a common allergen, and this has obviously happened numerous times, so you would think that they would attempt to make a change.

First impression was good.  The place was welcoming and had good ambiance.  We were seated quickly and the hostess was friendly.  Few minutes later hostess comes back as our waitress.  I noticed some cocktails were $9 and some were $24.  To me that either means some are sharable fishbowls or some are top shelf.  I asked the waitress what sizes the cocktails come in and she just stared at me.  So I clarified, asking in terms of ounces.  More awkward staring and she finally said she didn't know.  Ok.  No offer to walk 10 feet over to the bar and find out.  Cool.  I guess I'll be surprised when I order this Margarita... Got the perfect margarita and boyfriend got some pineapple thing.  Mine was strong but not great.  I wasn't a fan of his, but whatever.  Not my drink.  

We got the build your own guac and the red snapper ceviche as starters.  The guac was perfect.  Seriously great.  That's about it.  The ceviche was plated well and visually appealing, but that's it.  I took one bite and said ""nope"".  Boyfriend finished it because he was starving but didn't love it.  It was a bit overpriced, and tasted more like a seafood salad than a ceviche.  It really missed the light fresh flavors that are meant to come with citrus and onion and just felt heavy and overly fishy.  Not how I prefer ceviche, which is something we eat once every few weeks.  (I will point out that we didn't complain and it was gone when she collected the plates, so she likely had no idea we weren't satisfied and if you don't speak up, they can't fix it, so that's on us) 

I was going to order the fish tacos but learned they were out.  Was thinking about the lamb but they were out of that too.  After that I felt pressured to order so I just got a salad thinking it would be pretty hard to screw up.  Wrong again.  It looked like it would have been great if it had a different dressing and base.  The toppings (tomato, radish) were fresh and looked good but the spinach/lettuce was a bowl of wilted soggy slop.  I really wasn't a fan of the dressing; probably should have gotten it on the side.  Tried my boyfriends' spicy tacos.  Got no spice (and I'm a weenie when it comes to spices usually).  Ordered a different cocktail, something with jalepeno.  It was just ok.  Not bad but not great.  

I felt like there was a lot of time where we were just sitting & waiting for her to come back.  They weren't terribly busy but I think she was the only server; didn't see anyone else. At nearly $100 for 2 of us I don't think we'll be back.",2015-01-05 21:32:25

Then things got worse with our Deluxe sashimi order. The octopus we were served looked unappetizing with a brown colour which I have never seen before. The server again fixed things by switching out the octopus for another fish (salmon). However it's disappointing that the sushi chef served the octopus in the first place. The rest of the fish was quite disappointing in quality (freshness) and generally poorly cut. The next day I did not feel great in the morning as a result of this meal and I do not see myself coming back again. One would expect higher standards especially for the prices being charged.

My only complaint with Patachou was their cappuccino (taste and price) and the price of a croissant. Maybe I'm just acting spoiled since I just got back from a month in Europe where the croissants were 1 euro and the cappuccino's were 2 euro... but $5 each is a bit pricey to me. Additionally, the cappuccino looked like it was made extremely quickly as it was half milk foam and it just didn't have a great flavor to it. Maybe that was just a one off incident though. 

Overall, I'll be back again and again! I love Cafe Patachou and all the other Patachou restaurants. Indy is lucky to have them!",2017-05-31 20:06:33

My roommate quickly mentioned the coupons and we didn't get a reply so we waited. A girl came out with our drinks and we handed over the coupons and she said I don't mean to be rude but in the future try to mention these when you order and we said that we did mention them but we couldn't tell if he was still listening since we didn't get a response.

I have a favorite dish: Pasta Fra Diavolo, spicy tomato cream sauce, campanile pasta with chicken.  The chopped starter salad is excellent with lots of veggies and a light italian vinaigrette dressing.  My husband enjoyed the filet mignon and mashed potatoes about a year ago, but when we returned recently, the filet was comparable to a hockey puck.  He asked for medium-well, but there was no pink.  The mashed potatoes were dry and clearly had been sitting around for some time.  He returned the dish to the kitchen and did not ask for a replacement.  The dish was removed from the check.  The manager gave us coupons for free appetizers next visit.  One more thing to know is that the cocktails are really good; however, my husband and I sat at the bar last night and saw that the way they ""wash"" glassware is less than hygienic.  Not sure if this is normal, but they dipped glasses into to different sinks containing solutions and then put them back into the inventory for use.  We stopped ordering drinks after than.

Atmosphere - Modern retro with a twist of industrialism.  Sounds like I just described a painting.

  Drinks - Just water today.

  My Meal  
    Main Course - I had the apple cinnamon French toast combo plate.  Apples inside the bread made into French toast coated in cinnamon.  Perfect!  Two eggs over easy cooked perfectly and oozed its yummy goldenness all over my plate.  I had to steal a slice of toast from my wife to help mop it up.  Then I had one patty of Mark Estee's Reno Provision sausage, simply yummy.  I only wish it was bigger, but I knew it was before ordering.  I love how their plates are egg shaped.

Service - My wife's order was particular and out waitress was able to figure out what she want and make it happen.  So big kudos for handling my wife's special order and getting the kitchen to deliver the way my wife wanted it.  The only drawback was the service almost came to a stop as they were flooded with new customers.

Appetizer - Wasn't here for that.

Main Course - Wasn't here for that, and did not see the menu board for the other place.  

Dessert - The Raspberry Beret was had a fresh raspberry on top.  There was very little raspberry jam filling, I could have used a lot more of it.  But the amount there did keep the cupcake moist.  The Gimme S'More cupcake itself was dry, nothing that special.  I loved the frosting which was a marshmallow butter cream, the texture was very much like a freshly melted marshmallow.  The graham cracker crumbs were lack too.  For $2.50 a cupcake I thought that was little much.  If I had the bottom of the Raspberry Berets and the top of the Gimme S'More I think that would have been perfect.  I did love the box that held them.

Service - I felt weird walking in.  It felt as if I was in the wrong place and did not belong there.  After I found the counter the lady was helpful.  I explained that I had a LivingSocial certificate and she recommend that I get four cupcakes as they are $2.50 a piece.  So I got two Raspberry Berets and two Gimme S'More.",2011-06-10 03:20:53

I've come on weekdays and weekends and it seems that the day of the week does not impact the fact that they are very slow. If you want to get a bagel here, your best bet is to order ahead over the phone. 

On this current visit, I ordered three breakfast sandwiches. After waiting 20 minutes (which I feel is a bit long) I went to the window to make sure they were working on my order. I had seen many people order after me and leave before me, so I was a bit frustrated. They told me they were still working on it. The reason I felt so inclined to ask is because the last time we were here, we waited 20 minutes for two breakfast sandwiches, and we were what seemed to be the only customers. When we approached the window to ask where our order was they told us they forgot it. Things happen, so we were understanding and came back.

While we stood outside waiting, we saw many customers confused about the ordering process. There is limited signage and it's very small.

After a full half hour, we finally got our order from a woman wearing a mask that didn't cover her nose.

Food overall: Meh
The charbroiled oysters were forgettable. They tasted more like they were barely warmed, rather than broiled. They still had a raw oyster flavor. 

We had planned on getting the shrimp toast, but decided to try out the soft-shell tempura shrimp since they were on the happy hour menu and because we don't often see soft-shell shrimp on a menu. The dish reminded me of something Benihana used to make. Everything was edible including the head, tail and eyes. While the texture was pleasant enough, the dish was lacking in flavor. The sauce accompaniment was lackluster and too spicy. 

I had read that the peanut butter semifreddo was like eating a frozen Snickers bar. In actuality, I would've preferred an actual frozen Snickers bar. The dessert was overrated and not worth the $9 we paid. 

The brussel sprouts were the highlight of the night. They were tender and flavorful as always. I'd prefer some bacon fat like Ruth's Chris version, but they were still good. 

Our server was friendly and fast and provided great service throughout dinner; there were no disappearing acts the later it got. 

Ambiance is always nice and tonight was no different. We stepped in for a bite to eat before heading to the Saenger. Between 5:45 and 7:00 pm on a Wednesday, the restaurant was pleasantly quiet. Borgne can be obnoxiously loud at lunch time, so this was a nice change of pace.

We shared the calamari with martinis for appetizers. The calamari came breaded in a edible rice/sesame seed bowl and was served with three delicious sauces. I couldn't stop snacking on the bowl. But the sauces stole the show.  The martinis were nice and cold, and a generous pour. 
For dinner we ordered the grilled shrimp with rice ($29) Sides are a la carte and shareable. We shared the truffle fries and creamed spinach. The shrimp were huge, meaty and cooked to perfection - tender and flavorful. The rice and spinach did not disappoint. Yummy. Only one minor complaint was with the fries.

I should have listened to the other elites. Upon entering the place was dead! At noon on a Thursday, that was strange. The floors were also very sticky, first thing I noticed walking in. The guy taking orders was very nice. He went through the menu and ordering process because it was our first time there. 

Now for the food. We started with the chips and queso with a side of salsa. The chips were stale and in pieces, we've had better out of a bag. The salsa was ok but was not fresh as stated, it was from a jar. The queso was the worst and tasted like it came from a can. My wife ordered a fajita salad with chicken. The salad was bare bones and lame. The fajita vegetables were raw, who does that? Raw onions and green peppers. They only offer 2 types of salad dressing. The chicken was seasoned well but there wasn't much of it. I went with the 2 tacos and added and extra. All 3 were steak with everything. The shells I swear we're out of a box. The steak was seasoned well but again there wasn't much meat and it was extremely thin. The tacos were edible but not great. I could have made better at home. Paid $3.00 for guacamole and never received. They also make you pay for water. They do have fountain machines, they usually have a water feature. We were told only bottles were available. As a previous person said, there aren't any trashcans in the joint....

I would not go back at all. The food was mediocre at best and it's very expensive. $33.00 for a bad lunch, we could have went to Chipotle for a much better lunch. 1 star for customer service.",2017-04-06 17:52:18

I ordered the blt, it was just okay. The bun wasn't toasted. The bacon was scarce and it was dry. The fries were good as always. The wife had the veggie burger and she seemed to enjoy it for the most part. She skipped the bun but the burger itself was a bit dry. Her side salad was nice and fresh with a large variety of dressing.

The selection of sushi rolls is outstanding.  If it's not busy, they'll consider doing custom rolls for you.  Combine all of that with a clean, bright, modern looking space, and i am, depsite my desire to hate them, sold.  it's one of my favorite sushi restaurants at the moment.

The sushi rice was over cooked, gummy and excessively sweet on each of my visits. This doesn't set up the fish for success. The other major problem I have is the overwhelming size of the sliced fish itself. Once placed atop the rice the shear mass of the nigiri ""bite"" makes it nearly impossible to eat in one piece. I found the same to be true with the sashimi as the pieces were really large and thick making it very difficult to swallow.

What I loved about the meal was that the restaurant specializes in South Indian cuisine, including dishes from the Chettinad region and the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Because they specialize in the cuisine of this region, the menu offered a lot of dishes I'd never had before. I had a hard time narrowing down what to order, so I just ordered A LOT and figured we'd eat it over a few days! Worth it. 

So what did we eat? From the starters section of the menu, we tried Egg Podimas (shredded hard-boiled egg tossed with veggies and Southern Indian spices) and Kyma Idli (shredded rice cakes grilled in South Indian spices and house-made masala with choice of protein - we chose lamb). The Egg Podimas was good - a sort of South Indian flavored egg salad since it was hard-boiled eggs rather than scrambled (which I found some recipes for online). The Kyma Idli was delish - well flavored and a good texture. I loved it.

From the mains, we tried the Chettinad egg curry (hard-boiled eggs in a Chettinad curry tomatoes and onions), Kothu Parotta (shredded parotta/paratha cooked in spices with your choice of protein - for this dish I chose paneer), and pepper chicken curry (boneless chicken cooked in South Indian black pepper sauce). All three were really good. It was the first time I've ever had hard-boiled eggs in curry - yum! The chicken was tender and delicious. But the Kothu Parotta was my favorite. 

Both the Kyma Idli and Kothu Parotta reminded me of an Ethiopian dish I love - firfir (leftover injera cooked in a Berbere-spiced sauce). The idli and the parotta cooked down in their respective sauces to make for interestingly textured and very tasty dishes. 

I also ordered a dosa, but sadly the filling/paste for the dosa didn't make it into my to go bag. I look forward to trying it for real next time (it was the Nethili - anchovy - curry dosa, which sounds so interesting!). For dessert, we tried the Ras Malai (soft cheesecake patties soaked in milk flavored with cardamom), which was a good way to end a spicy meal! 

Despite trying so many dishes, there are a lot more dishes I'd love to try! They also offer dishes that are more familiar offerings from Indian restaurants if you want a familiar/already loved dish (Paneer Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, saag, Kurma, Vindaloo, Biryani, Chana Masala, Pakora, Samosas, dosas, and more). They have the dishes you already love and maybe some you haven't had the chance to experience yet (at least that was the case for us)! When ordering, they offer several spice levels for their dishes. We went with Spicy for our dishes and they were! 

I ordered online on their website. They texted me to confirm my order and then texted me when the order was ready. They have curbside if you prefer (I think you just call them when you're outside), but I just popped in to get my order after they texted it was ready. Their lobby area is pretty spacious, and no one else was inside waiting for their meal when I went in. It looked like they did offer dine in, but the few tables are really far apart and it wasn't busy inside. 

The menu is varied and exciting and the food is delicious. Other than forgetting a couple of items I ordered (the anchovy paste for the dosa and a drink I ordered), the meal was near perfect. And it's understand that certain items sometimes get forgotten with takeout and given how much food I ordered! I'll happily go back and get an absurdly large order of food again!",2021-02-24 01:48:05

The restaurant accommodated us being early, mainly as the table was ready and unoccupied.  One advantage of getting an early reservation.

It is a comfortable old neighborhood restaurant.  You know you are coming here for the food, not the decor.  Although the plates on the wall do present a different touch, especially after hearing the story behind them.  The owner's names on the bathroom doors signs add a comical touch.  

My wife started with the Lobster & Brie Cheesecake with Lemon Aioli.  It was so good, she was reluctant to even let me have a taste.  After the taste, I agreed with her.  I started with Jenny's Salad; the Blue Cheese, apples, and spiced pecans definitely give it a different style and flavor.  I liked it.  

It was one of those rare nights where both of us decided to leave our comfort zones and try something different.  And we had decided upon the same entree, the Coconut Curry Thai hot pot.  As soft shell crabs were on the menu, we replaced the flounder with a fried crab.  I can't complain about the portion or the amount of seafood (shrimp, crab meat, and calamari) in the sauce.

The meal was interesting.  There was some herb or spice in the sauce that was a little off-putting.  I couldn't quite pin it down, but it just wasn't to my taste.

Seems like everyone else had that same idea. It was a hot when we showed up and the line was out the door. We waited in line for 10-15 minutes. Eventually I realized that since we were only there to play arcade games we could purchase a card from a machine and didn't have to stand in line. Better signage or a person directing traffic, especially when the line is out the door, might be helpful. 

Once inside, things moved much quicker. We bought our card (I paid 35 dollars for the two kids to share). The kids wanted to race and there were lots of options so that they weren't standing around waiting a long time to play. After multiple car and motorcycle races we ventured to other parts of the arcade. There were VR games, shooting games, carnival like games, basketball shooting and bowling. There were also tons of claw grabbing prize games (too many as my kids wanted to do all of them). 

We had one issue, a game malfunctioned without my kids or I even realizing it, and an employee jumped right in and corrected it.

Main Event is a fine way to spend a hot afternoon indoors. It is a bit pricey but seems comparable to other venues that do these same types of activities. I hope to come back with some adults and try some of the other things they have to offer.",2021-04-11 12:13:31

The decor is clean and rustic, with plentiful seating and an open kitchen that constantly replenishes the buffet-style display of food.

At first, I was confused by the honor system payment scheme - the customer chooses their food, then pays at the end, after having eaten. It's an idea that definitely encourages the friendly community feel of the place, and an idea that could only ever work on the Main Line. 

All the food I tried was great, though the items certainly added up quickly! After much deliberation (everything, especially the pastries, looked great!), I got the pulled pork sandwiches, a chicken pot pie, a canelé, and a flat white. The coffee was excellent and the chicken pot pie, though lukewarm, was flaky and flavorful. I would have liked to see more reasonably priced vegetable side options - the salads were all priced as full meal portions and there were no other plain vegetable sides (e.g. green beans or brussels sprouts) available. 

Malvern Buttery is deservedly super popular, attracting families, students, and local workers alike. We arrived right before the lunch rush, so the buffet bar was well-stocked, but when the crowd came, we did notice that all the buffet items got snatched up quickly and quite a line formed to pay and order coffee. All in all, Malvern Buttery is a really great lunch/coffee option in Malvern, and I'd definitely stop by again next time I'm in the area.",2018-01-02 22:26:33

The pretzels were okay. I prefer a good, fresh one from Target actually. Of all places. 

The fountain Coke was not carbonated enough. That stinks because it's 100% fact that good fountain Coke is practically the best thing ever. 

I will probably try it again. I would like to try the jalapeno sauce or the cheddar sauce.

Lit candle on table. Had to move that out of the reach of my monkey-armed 14 month old son. (Seriously, the kid looks like he has normal arms but when he wants something, they can expand like Plex's arms on Yo Gabba Gabba) 
They bring out bread, it's warm. That's nice. I like bread. I like warm bread even more. 
MMMMmmmm bread. Not even the best bread I have ever had. But good. 
And warm. 
And my wine was decent. Cold. Clean glass. 
Same thing, the beer. Cold, clean, good. 
Alcohol a little premium-priced here but whatever. 
Then salads. 
They're ok. Not much cheese on them. What can I say? Much like I like bread, I like cheese. Except I love cheese way more. So, could have used more cheese. And maybe a little less sugar in the dressing. But, really, for all my complaining, I enjoyed it still. 
Service was perfectly fine. 
Pizza came out: black olives, StL style. 
Pretty decent pie. I have had better (Hi, Stefanina's!) and I have had much, much worse (Eff you, Imo's!) and this hit the spot pretty well. 
Owner (Mike Nicoletti) came out and introduced himself and shook our hands. How lovely!

First off, we were waiting to be seated as a line accumulated behind us. The restaurant wasn't really busy at all. It was nearly empty. When the manager / hostess finally came up to seat us she thought we were a large party. I said no, we have just been waiting awhile. She stated she was dealing with a complaint. She then sat us at a table very near the door to the kitchen. The server saw us but no one came out. 10 minutes later the hostess came over and asked if anyone had been at our table yet. We said no, she asked our drink order. We were actually just saying we picked the wrong place and were going to leave. She grabbed our drinks and said she would have the server come over to take our order. It was 7 minutes before she came. At this point I was actually timing things. It was that bad.

 When she finally took our order we had 2 chicken fried chicken dinners and a biscuits and gravy breakfast. Nothing that should have taken 27 minutes to come out!!! Then, it was obvious it had been sitting in the window awhile. The chicken was hot in the center but everything else was very mildly warm. I am sure it never would have passed health code inspection. Our server did not bring out our dinner someone else did. She did stop by to drop off the check immediately after we got our food. She never returned. Luckily there were others to refill our drink once but aside from that, we were on our own. 

We actually considered breaking something to get someone over there to refill our drinks. The hostess who I believe was also the manager on duty was fully aware of the situation but only said I hope it gets better now. Oh, I hope your cracker barrel experience improves....

Upon checkout, she said how was everything? I said terrible, server was awful and food was cold. She said oh thats surprising, we did get busy earlier so maybe everyone is just tired now.....REALLY?

I enjoyed the hollowed-noodle bucatini for a change of pace. Loved the mixed greens salad, a fairly common (these days) combo of pears, walnut and goat cheese.

Friend C ordered teh Strozzzpreti---Pastaria's Bolognese.  It was a little weird---too rich and bacony for my taste.  My friend enjoyed hers, with leftovers to spare that she gobbled up in the car after an evening at the Thaxton Speakeasy (apparently moonshine stimulates the appetitie!)


 Friend L ordered the Bucatini and concurred with my opinion.  She also tried the Shaved Kale salad.  She liked---I thought it was a bit wet.  I wouldn't be tempted to order it.

Friend J love, love, loved her pistachio ravioli---which is probably the thing to order since it's not so comon.

We shared some Risotto Balls----everyone enjoyed, some to a great degree than others.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  I loved the decor and will probably go to the restaurant again, as I think it's right up my husband's alley.

This time I got the chicken cheesesteak with spinach provolone and special sauce.

Like other yelpers have said -- it's huge chunks of fresh chicken breast -- don't expect the usual minced up / cut up meat that normally represents a cheesesteak. I will say that, I do sometimes crave that cut up minced up because it's less dry and absorbs cheese much better. But this is a great alternative

For example, we ordered a couple of rolls based on the ingredients listed: cotton candy and vegas. And while they list the main ingredients, you don't know what the sauce or toppings are. So, if you're avoiding something for I don't know, allergy reasons, you may be surprised so ask in advance. 

Interesting and innovative rolls but deceiving to a degree.",2019-05-01 02:24:15

They did have a delicious beer (unfortunately by Schlafly) that I enjoyed (Kolsch). 

The service was average. It was relatively packed for a weeknight.

Fette Sau would be right at home in the Texas Hill country. Perfect ambiance, great smells emanating from the pit, and a friendly staff. Having a new BBQ pit is a lot like having sex for the 1st time. It's good, kind of awkward getting used to, but definitely gets better with time. The best pits in Texas have been seasoned for over 50 years and you can taste the history in every smoke ring on the brisket...low and slow is the only way (also like sex). Fette Sau is very good but will only get better. The sauces on the table will accommodate any taste from Texas, Memphis, Kansas City and Carolina style BBQ. And the links pay homage to Philly being more of a spicy Italian sort compared to the traditional southern sausage.

Two things go well with BBQ...whiskey and beer. Fette Sau hits the mark on both. A vast whiskey selection (I had a nice Rye straight up), and a decent beer selection. They even have little vials of water with droppers in them to ""open up"" the whiskey. I felt right at home listening to the great music and getting my hands good and greasy.

There is indoor dining as well as an outdoor patio. There is a hip bar/club vibe to this restaurant and it seems like they are looking to be a fun bar with good food as opposed to a spot you go just to enjoy a great meal.

Things I like: The food was overall very good. I enjoyed everything we ordered. I particularly liked the Steamed Pork Gyoza, Pork Sticky Ribs, and the Torch Hamachi Roll. The sushi rolls we ordered were very good, but there is more of an emphasis on creating creative sushi rolls here than having quality fish available. The menu doesn't really emphasize any Sashimi/ Nigiri (says available upon request), which would better showcase the quality of the fish used. 

Things I didn't like: I wanted more of a quiet dinner environment and that is not what you find here. The patio music was extremely loud at 5pm on a Friday evening. This is something I never normally care about, but I couldn't hear those at my table. I asked if the volume could possibly be lowered and the waiter said that they would not do it. I would have liked to see much more care placed on the comfort of their guests. Additionally, the sushi rolls were creative, but the quality was not at a level where I would be excited to return to the restaurant. 

Overall, Haiku emphasizes having a fun bar environment more than the quality of their food. This is a nice place to hang out with friends, but I wouldn't come here just for the food. There is better sushi available in Tampa at a better price as well.",2022-01-14 16:47:26

We have lived in Tampa for almost 9 years and just recently heard about their endless hibachi & sushi. They do take reservations, 1-2 days in advance. This could help you avoid a long wait. We went for lunch on a Saturday, and there was a 45 minute wait for a table. They have a special lunch menu with limited items, but very large selection. My husband and I tried a little bit of everything. The sushi just didn't do it for me. I only tried 2 of them before I gave up. The dancing crab roll was recommended, and it was just ok. I wasn't really expecting the WOW factor due to it being endless, which to me means a little bit of lower quality. I also tried the crazy salmon roll, which tasted like tuna fish. I only finished it because I didn't want to get charged for leftovers. We split the coconut chicken, which was heavily breaded and topped with a coconut sauce. I think from the small plate they brought out there was honestly 1 large piece of chicken, and the rest was fried batter. The Mongolian beef was flavorful, spicy, but drenched in sauce. We swear there was a whole onion included on the plate. The portions of the hibachi were the perfect serving, so you didn't over eat, and leave too much behind. For a $11 per person, endless lunch, this wasn't terrible. Will I be back soon? Not in too much of a rush, but would eat there again. Don't expect fast service. If you order hibachi items, they take about 15-20 min to come out. Sushi was averaging about 10 minutes, even though it was already pre-made.

They make it fluffy, so it's not as thick and filling as a regular Belgium waffle, but has the same great taste topped with delicious ice cream! 

The menu does not have descriptions, so definitely ask the wait staff about anything you want! Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and explained several of the appetizers and entrees to us in order to make a decision. The extensive wine list is also in Italian, and I usually drink Napa Valley Cabernets, so the waitress recommended one of the best wines I've ever had! 

They serve a variety of salad, pasta, seafood, and meat entrees along with a large selection of bruschetta, meat, and cheese appetizers. 

Appetizer must: Sal's famous meatballs with tomato covered potato. You get three juicy meatballs with a little potato underneath them, and the flavors were impeccable!

We were looking for pasta and had the ricotta and tonnarelli dishes. Both were outstanding. While other reviews mentioned ""generous"" portions, I would categorize them as below average for what we usually receive at high-end Italian restaurants. We both finished our plates and could have eaten more, whereas usually I cannot finish an entire pasta entree. This was even after consuming one appetizer, fresh bread (provided to all patrons but with no dipping oil), and our complimentary side (described below).

The service was top notch! Besides our waitress being attentive and knowledgeable with everything, we were offered a complimentary side that we shared while waiting for our meals because the chef was not happy with how the entrees resulted. Therefore, he started over while we enjoyed the side. We greatly appreciated this level of service! 

I'm surprised it's rated $$$ because most entrees were $16-20 a piece minus a few exceptions. We got a bottle of wine, two entrees, one appetizer, and one dessert for $115 plus tip! The ambiance was upscale, yet we saw people wearing anything from t-shirts and flip flops to dressy. 

They have $18 valet that is the best option unless you want to park and walk quite a bit. They had outdoor tables, but we opted for inside as outside seating is on the sidewalk by where everyone arrives, walks by, and valet.

The wine selections looked promising, but none of the wines I had matched the tasting notes very well, and all of them seemed really one dimensional.

Once ordered, though, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately, it wasn't very good... I'm not very sensitive to saltiness, but three out of our four dishes seemed to think salt was a substitute for actual developed flavor.  The chickpeas and shishitos were drenched in a salty spice rub, and the chickpeas were still in their shells - ""like edamame,"" the server said.  Too bad that chickpeas are too mushy to eat like a soybean - they don't pop out of the shell and into your mouth so much as get mangled in the process.

I also had the gnocchi with corn, wood mushrooms, baby tomatoes, and truffle butter.  Again, the gnocchi themselves were flat, as were the tomatoes.  The corn had flavor, but it just tasted like corn... and some of the wood mushrooms were tough and inedible.  The truffle butter itself had absolutely no truffle flavor, but again, was over-salted.

Unfortunately, the local show ended at 10:30p and everything in T.S. closes between 9 and 10p, even on a Saturday night! As we cruised down the sponge docks slowly looking for signs of life within restaurants, I spotted Hellas Bakery, brightly lit with workers behind the counter. We parked and ran in, through the bakery into the adjoining restaurant where a hostess still stood behind her podium. She regretfully informed us however that the restaurant was closed and only the bakery remained open. Sadly, we wandered back outside where we stood on the sidewalk, contemplating our options: bar food or Awful Waffle. Things were looking bleak until the Manager (or perhaps he was the owner?) came outside and explained to us that although the kitchen was shut down and most of the food put away, if we wanted simple items such as salads or gyros, they would accommodate us. So he escorted us into the empty restaurant and told us to take our time. Our waiter, who I expected would be irritated at having to stay later to wait on us, was VERY gracious and also let us know that we shouldn't feel hurried to eat our food. My friends had gyros which they said were quite good. I was perfectly happy with a generous plate of marinated feta, olives, and warm, crusty bread. And the home-made Greek dressing on my salad was the best I've ever had! Ever!

I hang out in Gulfport almost every Wed night and like to grab a chicken quesadilla and irish coffee at O'Maddys before swing dancing but this was the first time coming around for breakfast. I love the area! We went on a Thursday morning at 8:30am so we were the only ones there but even so, I expected it could be a wait for the food. Still, I would have preferred to get our drinks (iced Thai coffee) as soon as they were ready but the they waited until our food was ready before delivering any of it to our table outside, which was about 15 minutes. 
Again based on reviews, we ordered the Lisa bowl (can't go wrong with goat cheese), a breakfast wrap and the dish with rice, chai tea, honey, avocado and toasted coconut. Yes, the servings were small by  gorging American standards but the portions were reasonable. We didnt walk away full but still satisfied. And yes, everything was very fresh and tasty.  The Lisa Bowl was good but not mindblowing and after a bite of my sister's breakfast wrap, found myself wishing I had ordered that instead. However the rice dish was delightful! And it looks very simple to make so I may try my hand at it (by boiling rice in chai tea, drizzling it with honey and topping with avocado and toasted coconut). 
The coffee was a disappointment though, which I did not expect. I too have a freezer full of coffee ice cubes because I like iced coffee that is not ""watered down"" by regular ice cubes. So in that respect, Tea and Me is doing it right but my iced Thai coffee was luke warm, with coffee cubes melting in what was obviously fresh brewed HOT coffee. I have a cold brew system at home so I expected that a place that knows enough to ice coffee cubes would also cold brew (or brew and chill) their coffee for cold orders. 
There is wi-fi and a seating area outside so you can sip and work (or study) but no view to speak of since this spot is not along the water.

I guess the cooks saw it on the ticket, knowing that I had paid (as you pay when you order), and just decided to leave it out and not mention it? Unhappy about that.

- Very Authentic.

- Nice outdoor seating area in the warm weather months

- Excellent Tacos (soft corn tacos filled with a variety of tender, slow cooked meat options)-To die for!
- Great Quesadilla (filled with pork and pineapple, refried beans, etc.) - Yummy BARGAIN!

- The restaurant building is small and not ideal for dining in.
- The neighborhood is eclectic and interesting, but it is a bit dodgy.

Double Knot is an extension of Sampan (literally, you can walk back and forth between the restaurants).  The happy hour menus are identical at both spaces and they share a kitchen downstairs.  The idea of prepared food, coffee and things in the morning, combined with great food in the evening will clearly be a success.  The classy, rustic, reclaimed space at Double Knot is great, and I don't mind a change of atmosphere to eat Sampan's food.  

The problem, like most reviews have noted, is the service.  I can understand some opening week issues, but there are more problems than that.  When you walk in, there's an open space in front of the bar (where you'd think there would be a host, like Sampan).  We stood with three other couples for about five minutes before a bartender told us the tables are first come, first serve, or to go to the host stand in the back for dinner tables (really awkward).  There were no napkins or utensils on the tables, and each couple around us had to ask for plates, water and place settings.  The sushi was served without chop sticks, soy sauce or plates.  The food runners have no idea where to deliver the food.  They kept trying to randomly deliver food to the tables, and it got so ridiculous that we and the couple next to us just started accepting the random food.

I really enjoyed the Block! From my experience the items that are a little cheaper tend to be much tastier! I went with a big group after my graduation and the people in my party who ordered the specials and the bigger plates/entrees seemed not to be satisfied with their meal (i.e., someone ordered the steak and didn't love it, someone else ordered the fish special and was not thrilled)... but everyone who ordered the sandwiches/burgers really seemed to love it. All the drinks and cocktails were delicious. 

Items I really love: the bacon jam, and the brussels sprout! Also the burger and pulled pork sandwiches are delicious here! 

I was a little nervous because I had a large group and they dont take reservations! But I just called in ahead of time to check and they said they would work it out. I appreciated how accommodating they were! Everyone who works here is so friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the service is EXTREMELY slow and the wait staff seems super disorganized. For instance, one time I went there there were 3 different waiters who tried to serve us (even after we explained someone else was already helping us).

The space were divided into different areas: dining, bar, lounge, private room and outdoors. Each section was just lovely and I wanted to try out each area but ended up in the dining room area with a view of the outside space. 

When it came to ordering food, I had a hard time choosing what to do order since the menu was quite diverse and had many tempting options. I read reviews before coming here so I chose the dumpling sampler and ordered calamari because I really like squid. My boyfriend likes eggplants and so he ordered that. The food definitely score a lot of points on presentation. My favorite dumpling was the lamb. As for the calamari, It was ok. I just didn't like the sauce and prefer the sauce that came with the crab cake poppers instead. The eggplant was not the best I had but I like the change from the ones from Chinatown where they were drenched in oil and sauce. I feel that Empress Garden in Chinatown Philly has the best flavor for eggplants. For dessert I chose the crème brulee because I love crème brulee. Overall, the food was ok, some were a bit on the salty side for me. 

It was a pleasant experience. I would definitely come back to try our other food on the menu and different space areas. Also it was nice to know they offer complimentary valet.

The Sushi Burrito has FINALLY arrived in STL and it's everything I hoped it would be! 
A small restaurant along Vandeventer, Blk Mkt Eats sits near the SLU campus which makes it a perfect spot for students who are craving something fresh and full of bold flavors. The menu consists of 7 mouthwatering options which you can make into a sushi burrito or a bowl. They also offer 3 types of sushi nachos (which I'll have to come back for). So what did we have?

-OG Fire Sushi Burrito. Spicy salmon or tuna, Persian cucumbers, avocado, crispy shallots, tempura crunch, masago, jalapeno, OG Fire sauce. Like heat? Ask for extra jalapenos.
-Seoul Delicious Sushi Burrito. Grilled chicken, kimchi slaw, bibb lettuce, BLK MKT pickles, carrots, crispy shallots, gochujang mayo. 
-Shake Poke Bowl. Hawaiian-inspired tuna poke, Persian cucumbers, avocado, green cabbage, sesame seeds, crispy shallots, tempura crunch, alaea sea salt, unagi sauce. Super generous with ingredients as we were able to get a little bit of everything in EACH bite. This was probably my favorite!
-Tofu Nugs. Seasoned and fried tofu with your choice of OG Fire or a soy based sweet sauce. Beautiful crunch on the outside, soft tofu on the inside. I preferred it with the soy based sauce although to be completely honest, I would just eat these as is.... All day. Every day. 

A couple of things to make note of: 
1.) Finding a place to park is a bit tricky in this area. You may have to walk a little bit to get to the restaurant. 
2.) This is a TINY TINY restaurant, not ideal for big groups. I would advice that you call ahead and place your order for carry-out.

Just a note.. always good idea to make a reservation if you're wanting to guarantee no wait!

Been here twice in the last couple weeks... both times happened to have Zach as our server.  He was quick and efficient with good knowledge of the specials. 

So.. table side guacamole.. just can't go wrong and they give you spicy options since made right there. The firebread... just delicious with it's herby, buttery taste. 

Both times someone had the ribeye special  which you can add on the hot rock. Yes, sizzling hot rock that continues to cook the steak very quickly (so if you want on the rare side - watch carefully!). Regardless the presentation is fun and in my humble opinion everyone should experience at least once! 

When I was listening to the halibut special.. you kind of wonder how all those ""tastes"" as he's describing what it is are going to be -but all are umami together and not enough to go crazy over but delicious nonetheless (like carmelized shallot sauce, safron carrots or some exotic sounding puree of potatoes).

The drinks are served with cool (literally!) Ice cup. Then... dessert! The icecream lollipop tree. I thought it was odd it served with honey- but try it  - it does ""make it!"". The smores.. well.. way different than any smores (served on a shortbread cookie & brownie and with candied bacon. 

Michael (red shirt) nice fella.

These types of restaurants I'm always sort of wary when stepping in. You know, the type of restaurant where if you look out of place, you'll be stared at? This is what this restaurant reminded me of. So let's see, what did I order?

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Tacos. And what I received were just about 3 tacos, a bowl of beans, and a lot of disappointment. It just didn't fulfill me, as far as the amount and the price. It didn't justify it. The taste was alright, but I could've definitely have found better tacos around Tucson. Maybe there were better dishes that I didn't order, but hey as I said this restaurant wasn't really my typical scene.

The servers/counter people are friendly and eager to help you.  It's obvious that they have a lot of regulars at lunch that they know by name.

For my lunch, I chose the special...a slice of pizza, a salad, and a drink for 6.49.  I think this was a bargain!

The salad was nothing special, lettuce and tomato, but I'll say it was fresh.  Nothing worse than getting wilted salad, and that sure didn't happen here.

They had several options for their pizza, so I chose sausage, the safe choice.  It was a very generous slice of pizza, and I would say it was above average.  Not the best in town, but a cut above many others around.

They sell pizza by the slices and have a lot of 20oz soda options that you don't typically see which is pretty awesome. I love that they sell cream soda and vanilla coke!

Two steaks quasadillas, two chicken tacos and steak nachos. Tacos were bland. The quasadillas were basic with only steak and a cheese that was very hard and not tasty.

A beautiful 80 degree evening in Skippack, a lovely night to sit outside so I returned to the Parc Bistro after a couple years as I know they have seating outside, and NOT on top of a parking lot nor on the street.  The ambiance was wonderful. 

The service from both Greg and Jay was excellent, attentive, fast with the wine and brew refills (Bells Two Hearted IPA on tap, yum), and pleasant.

The mussels appetizer was more than enough to share for 2, probably good enough for 3.  It was steamed in Weyerbacher Merry Monks Belgian Ale, with honey goat cheese, green onions and fried shoestring potato on top streaked with bourbon mayo.  This was so friggin good, so decadent and soooo filling, I didn't need the bread (focaccia with olive oil and red pepper puree)  nor the dinner that followed, but I ate it all anyway.

I ordered the veal meatloaf for the entree, served with yukon mashed, a wonderful mushroom ragu, and the best tomato marmalade you will ever put in your mouth..  And I did, every friggin bite.  My friend had the soft shell crab special of the evening, served with risotto.  This again was a very large serving, and my friend, unlike me, could not finish...closet eater!!  ;-)

No room for dessert.  Sorry.  Maybe next time the mussels and dessert would be sufficient.  What the fuck was I thinking.!!

Perfect. The ambiance is just right, German beer hall feel, Bundesliga playing on TV's above the bar, long tables and proper glassware for each Brewery/Beer Style. The back room is spacious, a little loud, but very homey.  

Their German beer menu is unmatched.  They have breweries on tap that I am told are exclusive to them in this area and their bottle list is extensive.  The variety of German beer styles compliments the menu so well.  For example Aecht Schlenkerla makes the best smoke beers in the world, (you can find them on tap and in bottles here) pair so well with the 9 different wurst offerings.  

The house made Laugenbrezel (Pretzel) is a must starter, my wife orders Kartoffelpuffer aka potato pancakes every time we come and she loves them.  On this trip I went with the Wurstplatte which comes with two sausages from their list of 9!  I chose the Weibwurst (mild pork&veal) and the Feuerwurst (very spicy pork) with a double serving of potato salad.  The sausages are big portion wise and very fresh.  Feuerwurst was very spicy, but not enough to take away the pork flavor and had a nice snap when you broke through the casing.  Weibwurst may not look appealing because of its white appearance, but it was mild, juicy and tender.  Potato salad, served cold was delicious.

It's a great place to go watch sports, as there are TV's in just about every direction you could look. The booths even have their own personal TV's at one end, if turning your head just sounds like way too much work. It does get very full for large sporting events, so you might want to get in early for big games. For certain games, they will put the volume on over the speakers so you can hear what is going on. At all other times, they have a good selection of music playing throughout. The noise level is high compared to some other restaurants, but not enough that you can't have a conversation with anyone at your table. There is a bar area, an area for families, and outdoor seating available. I have come with some very large groups and they haven't had any problem getting together enough room for us all.

Most of the time I just find a seat at the bar, and the service has always been great. The bartenders make sure your glass is always full, and usually have a good recommendation or two if you are looking for something new in regards to food or drink. In my experience, I would put the bartenders as more sociable with the patrons than most comparable places, which I prefer over ones that seem to be there solely to take your order. The list of beers that they keep on tap includes a good variety of microbrews both brewed nationally and locally, and has something for everybody with around 30 beers on tap, with more selections available in bottles. They do a pretty good job of changing up what they have to offer, so there is usually something new to try and they offer samples of anything if you are wary about ordering something new. There are drink specials on most days that are as good as or better than most other places I have been to. They are also able to fill growlers here with beer from 3 Wise Men if you need beer to go.

Make sure to come hungry, because the food is always great with large enough servings to take lunch home with you for the next day. The burgers are really good and they offer some interesting combinations of toppings, but the wings are the best I have had in Indy.  If you make it in late at night like I usually do, they offer almost all of their appetizers at reduced prices.

I stopped in around 11:00 at night on Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Ralston's was only one of a few places that still looked like it had a decent crowd, and I pulled up a seat at the bar. The atmosphere is relaxed and it looks really nice inside. It's more upscale than a typical sports bar, but you won't feel out of place going in to get a beer and watch the game on one of their TV's. The patio was full when I got there, and it looks like a great place to sit and enjoy the weather while doing some people watching on Mass Ave. The beer list is pretty extensive and has quite a few offerings that aren't typically served elsewhere in Indy, but you can still get local offerings if you prefer. I don't know that I would say their beer offerings compete with some of the other well know beer venues in Indy as far as variety and tap rotation goes, but you can be pretty sure you are going to find at least a few on the list that you haven't tried before. The prices are on par with what you would expect, as you will spend $5-$6 on a draft of varying sizes depending on your selection.

If I was just going to rate them based on beer, location, and the atmosphere of the place I would not hesitate to give them 4 stars. The only reason this is a 3 star for me is because of the service. There was only 1 bartender that night, and he was working pretty hard trying to take care of both the bar and fill orders coming in from the wait staff. I assume that this was more related to somebody significantly misjudging that they wouldn't have a bigger crowd than usual with most people getting the holiday off on Monday, but it kind of ruined my experience. I'll definitely be back because they had a lot of other things going for them and I would like to try their food, so hopefully my service woes were just due to coming in on the wrong day. I look forward to pulling up a chair and catching a game here over some good beers, but I certainly hope they are better prepared when the major sports season gets into full swing.",2013-09-04 16:57:20

They certainly appeal to a lot of people, and it is a place that the standard crowd is going to enjoy dinner and a beer at. Their menu is certainly not the lowest common denominator of ridiculous bar food creations that some chains hang their hat on, but they have a menu that is appealing to the masses and the things I have had from here are good. 

This restaurant is located right in the downtown area, and is really convenient if you are downtown or at the convention center for a conference or event. They have a large bar area with lots of seating at the U-shaped bar, and plenty of tables in the rest of the separated bar space. There is another larger dining area on the other side, and a large room in the back that can be rented for private events. There is even a small outdoor area in front that is nice in the warmer months. The place does get busy, especially when there is a large event in the area. They get a large Colts crowd on game days, and fill up any time there is something on Georgia St. or at the convention center, and a lot of times they will do fun things to celebrate the event that is taking place. There are plenty of TVs around to see any sports games you want to see, but not quite as overkill as your typical sports bar will have. The setting is a little on the dark side and they have a lot of wood and brick. If you have a large group, this is a good place to look as they have lots of larger tables.

The menu runs the gamut with the typical things you see expect to see at American restaurants. It has lots of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, and a variety of main dishes that have some nicer options. They have some unique twists on a few standard dishes, and have options for vegetarians as well as gluten free dishes. I'm a big fan of their mac and cheese when I am in the mood to splurge on calories. 

Their beer is definitely one of their strong points. They have a standard lineup or 6 options that cover most of the major varieties. They do a really good job with these and they are all great for the style. None are that unique, but they are perfect for the standard everyday offering. Their seasonals are where they really excel. They are always unique and delicious, and I think this place is underrated as a brewery.  The issue, and the reason I'm not here as much as I might stop by otherwise, is that their seasonals usually only exist one or two at a time, and don't rotate all that quickly. If you like to see new things often at a brewery, this one probably won't deliver on that front. They do serve beer in to-go cups, so you can order a beer at the bar and walk right out with a plastic pint of beer to enjoy while walking around if you don't want to miss out on any action around town. 

Overall, they have a crowd-pleasing American style menu with a lot of options to likely have something everyone will enjoy. The place itself is nice, and they have a lot of space. I don't recall service ever being bad, but they have done well a couple times. Their beer is what sets them apart from similar establishments, and makes this a place I would recommend if you are looking for this style of dining.",2016-11-16 16:26:25

We ordered a white pizza and ten hot buffalo wings.  The food came fairly quickly and as we were about to jump right into the joys of delivery pizza we noticed that there were two pizza boxes, despite the fact we only ordered one pizza.  It became evident that the delivery driver who appeared friendly yet spacey, had given up someone else's order in addition to our own.  We called him and he came back for the extra pizza.  Their interpretation of our order was confusing but tasty nonetheless.  The white pizza was a regular pizza with no sauce, cheese, and sliced tomatoes on top.  The buffalo wings were full-on pieces of fried chicken.  We got the hot and they definitely weren't spicy at all, although they had a good flavor and there was way more of them than we had anticipated.

It's always fun, and the drinks are strong and large, but is it some of the best food in New Orleans? No.  I don't like burgers so I have only eaten the steaks, which in my opinion are overpriced and bland.  And yes the bacon that comes on the baked potatoes is a little weird.

My fiancé and my mother do not like creole/spice but they love Italian and this place advertises themselves as also an Italian fusion so we should be good, right? 
So we get seated and I will say the host and waitress where very friendly.  Our water was filled and my beer was brought right away. We started looking at the menu and the selection was very small if you are looking for an Italian or Italian ""fusion"" meal. 
So we all made up our mind and yes it took a little time for my mom and fiancé to make up their mind, maybe 15 minutes and both decided on the chicken parm which I will get back to. 
I started out with the gumbo. It came out fairly quickly as you would expect for a soup. I took a big spoonful of it and was super let down, it was almost flavorless with a very small amount of meat.i had to put a bit of salt into it just to give it something.
About 40 minutes passed between my soup and when our meals arrived, there was only 2 other tables in the dinning room at this time , however probably a dozen or so at the bar.. Not to busy to excuse this long wait. 
As I said 2 in my party ordered the chicken parm and it came over pasta that was cooked well however it was just a butterflied lightly breaded breast with a super thin, light tomato sauce that was very acidic and with virtually no seasoning and what looked like a light sprinkle of powdered parmasian cheese. Very flavorless and over priced for the dish.
 My father got the crab cake meal and he had said that his crab cakes contained a good amount of actual real crabmeat , they tasted as though they were made with stove top stuffing.. So needless to say he wasn't overly thrilled with his meal either. 
Now I got the popcorn crawfish poboy and it was stuffed with crawfish. The crawfish was battered and fried beautifully but had no seasoning as with everything else. 
We were all let down by the long wait for the meal , super disappointed by the food itself and not happy with the prices they charged for the sub par meals.

This tiny little ""loaf"" you get from them only feeds about 4-6 people. Ridiculous!

The vegetables were fresh, the bread was well toasted, and I appreciated that it came with the aioli, but still, the sandwich was nothing special. I couldn't help but think it tasted the same as a sandwich I could have gotten at a chain restaurant or cafe (I'm talking to you, Panera).

The service and food are still good.  Our water glasses stayed filled and our server was very attentive.  The owner walked around introducing himself to every table, asked if everything was okay, and engaged in small conversation.   

We started our night with home made charcuterie.  There were several meats.  The waiter did mislabel one of the meats as Spanish Prosciutto..huh?  I thought that would be called Serrano ham and besides the meat looked and tasted like salami.   

Besides that, the dishes I ordered looked and tasted great.  I loved the scallops.  They tasted buttery on the outside (I guess from being basted in butter) and creamy on the inside.  They were cooked to perfection.  The lobster risotto is a great dish also! It has taken me a while to write this review so I forget the special that we ordered but that was good.  

They have a nice selection of wines by the glass.  They sell full or half plates.  The half plates have a reduced price and allows one to try many dishes.

I was not in the mood for pizza (but the bites that I sampled from others was great), so I opted for their mac and cheese app and a house salad. Salad was fresh and very good for being just a salad, but the mac and cheese with gorgonzola and bacon was AH-mazing. They have regular mac and cheese as well as a daily mac and cheese special, which was the said app that I loved. I highly recommend it if available.

The beer selection was great for such a small place and being a ""pizza"" place. I loved the local brewery support and I really enjoyed the Unicorn Killer brew.

Unfortunately based on the two times I have visited TwinOak, the service was pretty awful. They just don't really seem to give a damn about your experience and are unfriendly and not on top of their game.

I don't know why I gave them 4 stars before. 

I've been here maybe a handful of times whenever I'm in the Sparks galleria area. And I have never been disappointed. Even the service is great. The little Asian girl that greets you is the nicest person ever. 

I got the BBQ pork with rice and it comes with fresh sliced cucumbers and pickled cabbage, bell pepper and carrots. 

That on its own is so yummy when you eat it with a bite of the rice and pork. I'm not sure if everyone knows that's the reason why it comes with all that. Because they want you to eat the rice and pork or whatever meat and take a fresh bite of the veggie. 

Not trying to toot my own horn, but Asian people are food geniuses. 

It reminds me of my own culture. Why do you think with our food they give you a little bowl of rice with your main dish, meat, fish whatever tofu. And then all those little crunchy veggie goodies on the side. It's a condiment, that compliments the food your eating. Hello kimchi!!! It goes great with everything. So the cucumber and pickled veggies are like the kimchi for us. 

Anyway. Also got the pork egg rolls. Not sure if it had pork inside of it, but it was still good. Husband got the noodle wonton soup. Very good and flavorful even when I can barely taste because I'm so sick. 

I've tried their tapioca drinks also and I loved all the ones I've tasted. The honeydew is my favorite. I definitely love this place and will be coming more often.",2015-12-02 05:03:01

The chicken tacos were good and a little more traditional, though the tortillas are better on 8th st. The arrachera was tasteless and did not have the traditional sides. The guacamole was good but very to much lemon the chips were good and the tortilla helping was generous. The servers were very nice though the food came out slowly.

During the summer, I tried the ""mini Rouge burger"" for the first time with some co-workers. Although not entirely like the Rouge, the 500 Degrees burger was the next best thing. I deemed it one of the best, if not the best fast food burger I have ever tried; better than Five Guys and even better than In-N-Out. If I wrote the review back then, it would probably be 4/5.

But, that was then. What happened? Did they change chefs/owners/something? I ordered the Classic Combo with truffle fries and the strawberry milkshake, while my lady got the burger of the week with the fried egg. We waited anxiously around 10 minutes and our number was called. We prepare to unravel the anticipated greatness to come, and BAM. Did I just get Punk'd? 

Everyone take a look at the photos that other Yelpers have submitted. Beautiful little thing, isn't it? This night, not so much! My burger was sloppily put together. The bun was squished and not at all like the glossy and puffy bun I remembered. Bad start so far, and it does not get better since they messed up my order and replaced my mushrooms with cooked red onions. After removing that, I took a huge bite to feed my burning appetite. Meh. I ordered medium rare and it came out medium to medium well. I remember the burger oozing its glorious juices all over my arm after the first bite. This was just a disgrace.

Her burger was not much better either. The burger was also put together like the McDonald's down the street from me, nasty. The egg had already popped and left a watery mess. She didn't even finish the burger. That doesn't make me feel too proud after talking up the 500 Degrees burger for so long.

The ""truffle"" fries barely tasted like truffles. It actually tasted normal, but was decent. It could have been a bit crunchier, since I hate limp fries. 

The milkshake was the highlight of our meal, but then again, who messes up a milkshake? 

Yes, this was a long review for a horrible experience. Yes, I am a little harsh on a relatively positive establishment.

Wow amazing! I had the most wonderful experience here... we made a reservation for the indoor seating and the interior of this place is so dreamy! They are also known for their garden seating outdoors because of the cute greenery surround it but it was too cold outside we wanted an indoor seating. 

My boyfriend surprised me with a reservation for our anniversary. This place is fantastic for dates! It's so romantic with the candles & dim lighting. We ordered the cheese board as appetizer. It came with 6 different types of cheese and nuts/jams that compliments them. You also get a bowl of chips/bread on the side. They also have a sheet of paper describing what cheeses are presented. We had so much fun sampling the cheese and reading about the flavors. That was an experience itself. 

For the the main entree we got the seared scallop & shrimp lemon risotto (rainbow cauliflower & jalapeño sides) and the smoked pork belly in onion-lemongrass soubise (apple & cabbage sides). Both dishes were amazing and came with amazing side vegetables. The flavor pairings are so unique ... definitely the best risotto dish I've eaten. The couple sitting next to us also seems to agree. 

We ended our meal with a key lime soufflé cake. We've had soufflé before but not sure what a soufflé cake is ... it tasted like a castella cake. Came with creamy graham ice cream on the side and the flavor pairing again was just amazing!! Sweet, tangy, but you can also taste some salty pebbles in each bite. 

They put so much thought into the menu. This is one of the best restaurant I have been to!! Funny story, the waitress randomly brought out two bite-size pieces of chocolate cake at the end along with a candles since she thought we were celebrating my birthday. That was so sweet of her ... even though we were here for our anniversary. But this just goes to show this place goes above & beyond with their customer care!!

If you're in Philadelphia, definitely make this place a restaurant bucket list!",2021-10-24 19:02:01

The waitress then brought us menus again and we told her we already ordered. I explained to her we were in a slight hurry so I asked for the check. I paid and she said the oysters would be out in a second. After waiting another 10mins still no oysters. We left! Hope someone got to enjoy our appetizer. 50+ mins of poor service. Appeared to have one waitress at 4pm on a Sunday...can't say it was all her fault. I give it 2 stars becaus the drinks were good atleast.,2013-11-25 17:50:29

I started with the roasted cauliflower...to die for! Perfect texture & taste. Next up, Salmon special with Parmesan crusted tomato, arugula pesto & a crab chutney (devoured). Lastly, my sister and I shared the Coconut Gelato & Tiramisu (both of which we took a single bite and left u finished). Neither was bad I think we just weren't in the mood for dessert after all.

The sushi was tasty, but nothing special. It could have been fresher.  I feel like they pile on the sauces and accouterments to hide sub-par fish.  A really good sushi doesn't need all that jazz.  Ok, we put in an order for 1 more roll and waited. With food in our bellies the wait wasn't as painful as the first round.  The wait for the check was definitely annoying though.

OK, so the burritos were ready 10 minutes after the time they were promised. I was also promised a 10% discount when I ordered and I suggested because they forgot my order and I was running behind now that Karina should give an additional discount. She graciously applied another $10 off. 

When the burritos were delivered I finally got an apology and a sorry for the wait.

The cioppino isn't very good (I don't think they even offer it anymore), the sandwiches aren't very good, but the burger is usually pretty tasty. The fries have improved and are usually pretty good.

The service is just as inconsistent as the food. Sometimes it is perfect, sometimes no one bothers to check up on you and you end up having a two hour lunch, anxious to get back to work.

Chris and I finally made it to Martin's before a preseason Predators game to try that white sauce that Aziz's character was raving on so much about. Unfortunately when we got there, it was busy. That was to be expected as there was the Predators game, but we were able to get to very cramped seats at the upstairs bar. It was uncomfortable and I was pretty much pressed against a pillar, but I'll endure for BBQ. 

Chris told me that it is a must to get chicken to go with the white sauce, so I did that. I don't know. I don't care for eating chicken with bones. I'm not really sure what my hang up is, I just don't enjoy it. Having said that, the chicken was good for the most part. Could've used more seasoning or something, though. The white sauce was good, but I would've liked more. I didn't feel I had quite enough.

Chris had a brisket sandwich. Usually when I get BBQ I get brisket. I tasted his and immediately wish I'd gotten brisket as well. Delicious.

I had high hopes, but this is a very crowded event. Very very crowded and everything has a long line. Everyone was just standing around in line. People didn't even know why they were in line. 
First it took 25 minutes to get into the Tarkington garage. It was very poorly designed and very small. Large trucks and SUVs have a hard time getting in and out of spaces. We should have parked across at the other garage and walked. It only took 20 to get out. Maybe they need people directing traffic in the garage. 
My goal was to find the baked cheese and hot wine. Both lines were huge. This was about 2:30 in the afternoon. We gauged both lines to just be too long. I did wait for about 20 min and we weren't even moving. I gave up and we did a lap around. It was hard to get to most of the booths with the lines. I do want to go back to at least get a 2017 ornament.  
The food booths seemed to be the busiest. I would have liked to see more local artists and crafts. Some of the German things were cool, but expensive. 
I doubt we will skate. It's too bad you can't reserve a time. You just have to show up and wait for a spot. Seems pretty chaotic. 
If you go be prepared to wait and wait, then wait some more. It's very crowded and I saw no seats or benches. There were a few high tables. And some firepits, but they blocked traffic and were hard to get around. It's just too small of a space. The rink takes up 90% and the other 20% is 40 huts. Very close and crammed together huts.",2017-11-28 02:09:46

I've tried several different house pizzas and the toppings are consistently flavorful but we all know that pizza, especially wood fired pizzas are all about the crust, and that is where this place fall apart. Every pie I've had here has been horrendously soggy and limp. With the telltale char marks and bubbles on the underside it really disappointing to bite in and be underwhelmed by too little chew and absolutely no crispness. 

Compounding the meh crust is the apathetic and personality-less service. I've yet to meet the owner or any of the kitchen staff so this may not be unilateral but none of the servers seem to give two craps about their jobs or your satisfaction.

Went there last week and sat at a table for 22 minutes before deciding to leave. It's one thing to be busy, but a completely different thing to avoid eye contact with a customer.

I had an extremely tasty meal here and would absolutely come back.  It definitely has a different vibe than the previous restaurant in this location (Chez Leon) and I have come up with a few pros and cons.

The pros are the great service and excellent food--the gnocchi Parisienne melted in my mouth and the prune clafoutis was delightful.  I think the only 2 entrees that were priced higher than $20 were beef. Other than that, all entrees were priced under $20 and they have a 3 course meal that costs $30.  

The biggest con to me was the fact that they restaurant seemed EXTREMELY high-staffed and, as a result, I think I counted about 11 staff sort of hovering around.  I know this is a new and hoppin restaurant, but it seemed like way too many people given the size of the space.  

My only other qualm with Brasserie that, believe me, wouldn't keep me from coming back, but just annoyed me were the red and white checkered table cloths.  They seem more like the stereotypical decor for an Italian restaurant, not French Brasserie.

The service was prompt, the sushi was delicious, I thought I would become a regular. My second visit didn't meet the same expectations. My third visit was the worst of them all and I won't be back for a fourth.

I decided to give Tokyo sushi another chance after Valentine's Day. I figured the apathetic service was due to the volume of customers they had on that special day. WRONG. Today's service was 10x worse than the last time. 

We arrived around 1:35 in the afternoon -- the bar was full, but the tables were nearly empty. We were quickly seated and given menus. We wrote down a few appetizers and rolls on the sheet of paper and stuck it at the end of the table and waited.... and waited some more... and our waitress finally grabbed it 10ish minutes later.

Our mussels came out first (which never seem to disappoint), then our pot stickers a few minutes later. We started to receive our rolls one at a time in 10 minute increments. I have no idea why they serve sushi this way. Sharing one roll at a time with your starving 6 foot something boyfriend isn't fun. We received our third roll and was told this was the last roll on our list which was a lie. My boyfriend and I looked at each other confused. We were missing our yakitan and two other rolls. The guy who delivered the sushi was gone before we could say anything.

We didn't get another sheet until another 15 minutes when the waitress walked by and we had to say ""excuse me"" to ask for a refill on our waters and a new order sheet.

We filled out the order sheet and placed it at the front of the table. I swear it must have sat there for nearly 20 more minutes. This was turning into the longest sushi date I had ever been on. When the waitress took the sheet I had asked if she could add some regular mussels to our order. She nodded and walked away. We received our rolls again, one by one, but no mussels. We see our waitress go to the table next to ours with an order of mussels and they had said ""oh, we already got our order a while ago."" And she turned around and took them back to the kitchen.

I asked a different waitress if she could check on our mussels. She asked if I wanted ""regular or baked"" and I replied with regular. 10 minutes later she comes back with BAKED mussels. 

I just don't get what's so hard about your job. I have never had such slow, crappy service in my entire LIFE. We didn't even get out of there until nearly 4PM. We spent maybe 30 minutes actually eating and probably two hours waiting for our rolls to be delivered. Big difference from my first visit to my last visit.",2016-05-02 01:57:57

I was informed by the waitress about the truffle pizza, with an egg on top--which just happens to be one of my favorite pizzas EVER. So I knew I HAD to go back for it.

The truffle pizza made me go back to Birra, and unfortunately it will probably be the reason I wouldn't go back to Birra. There was an uncomfortable amount of oil on top of the pizza that was literally dripping off each slice, the truffle flavor was very minimum, and the egg was surprisingly a fried egg dropped on the pizza (I had the impression that the egg would have been cooked on the pizza, while in the oven).

I'll start with the best thing about Metropolitan Grill:  their complimentary zucchini and sourdough bread!  I can eat that stuff all day, it's so good!  The zucchini bread is rich and sweet, but not too too sweet.  The sourdough bread is crunchy but soft on the inside.  I don't like the butter they serve with it, it's usually oversalted, but neither of the breads need it anyway.  They taste great on their own!

Now, let me get to the worst:  the service.  Since the most recent reviewer of Metropolitan Grill had the nerve to say that people who think the service is bad are ""1) rude, or 2) lousy tippers"", I want to address how invalid of a statement that is.  I take offense to it.  I am never, ever rude to staff anywhere.  I am universally considered to be overly nice to everyone I meet (I don't think you can be too nice, but others disagree with me).  I also tip no less than 15% (unless someone is downright mean to me), I commonly tip 20%, and have given up to 50% (and not on $3 checks, on regular restaurant meals for 2).  This person's review is useless due to the off base  generalizations he makes about other's reviews.

So when I say the service at Metropolitan Grill stinks, it certainly does indeed stink, and it has nothing to do with me.  It usually takes us 5-10 minutes (sometimes more) to be greeted by a waiter.  I've gone entire meals without a drink refill.  You can look into the back server station and see them all huddled there, often goofing off, quite often.  I've seen them hitting each other with towels before.  All while I was waiting for an iced tea refill.  Not good.  The staff has never been rude, though, they're just not attentive.

The food is inconsistent.  I like inconsistencies because that means the food is actually being prepared by the chef and they're probably original recipes, not canned or frozen goods.  However, when the food goes from being super delicious one visit, and disgusting to the point of being sent back to the kitchen the next, there's something wrong.  This happened with the Four Cheese Mac and Cheese that I ordered on our last visit.  I've had it in the past, and it was seriously the best mac and cheese ever!  It was rich, and creamy, and had some heat to it from the chiles.  The next visit it was just ok, and this last visit it was so bland and the breadcrumb crumble on top was so burned, that I had to send it back.  The manager had it remade for me, and not surprisingly, it still tasted bland and bad because the cheese sauce is pre-made.  But he comped the meal without being asked. 

My husband likes their french dip sandwich.  He says the meat is tasty and the bread is soft and fresh.  The fries are ok, nothing great, but not too bad.

I like their weekly special three-course meal.  You get a salad, whatever their entree special is, and whatever their dessert of the week is, all for $16.95.  (TIP: Make sure you ask your waiter about it and what the dishes are because some don't remember to tell you.)  It's a really good deal, and the special actually rotates, which is nice.  It adds a little variety to the menu. 

Their dessert menu is great, too.  The desserts aren't knock your socks off, but they're sized and priced right.  They're not giant, but for me and my husband, still shareable.  And they're only a couple of bucks.  They're a great way to end a meal with a little bit of sweets!  My favorite is the brownie with ice cream on top.  The brownie is rich and moist.  They put a lot of chocolate and caramel syrup on the dish, too, adding a little extra flavor to the whole thing.

The restaurant itself is kinda boring.  The decor doesn't say much.  It's ok though, but not a place I would go to for a special dinner.  

The prices are reasonable.  The portions are reasonable.  Overall, Metropolitan Grill is a restaurant I will return to.",2013-01-29 21:42:45

You wouldn't know that at all if you saw my plate after a meal at Diablo Burger.  I actually finish the entire thing here, because it is actually really good!

My main issue with restaurant burgers is that the meat is usually low quality.  I can't stand getting a bite with gristle.  On the contrary, Diablo Burger uses really high quality meat.  It is locally raised, grass-fed beef from their own trust in AZ, and it is unlike any beef you'll get at most places.  Just from the texture of the burger itself, you can tell how different it is.  It's more lean, but not tough or chewy to eat.  The meat is also darker and richer in color.  I order my burger slightly more well than they recommend (medium-well vs medium), which they always overcook closer to well, but it's still juicy and moist.  Grass-fed beef is more difficult to cook, so I sorta understand that they can't get it to medium-well consistently, even though I would like it.  But I'd rather have it more overcooked than under, especially since the beef is still juicy and tasty.  And no gristle!

The Blutarsky is my favorite burger.  Their guacamole is insanely flavorful and makes the burger even more juicy and yummy.  They put a good portion of it on the burger.  It adds a nice creaminess to it.  The English Muffin doesn't really do it for me, but it's ok.  I think a kickass bun would be better.  English Muffins can be a little dry and boring.  It works well enough, though.

Their fries are tasty, but too thin for me.  I like a bit more potato in the bite and less fried crunch.  Still, they're way better than most places.

I think it's ridiculous that they don't have a soda fountain.  Right, ok, they don't want to serve the corn syrup/artificial drinks.  I get it, but I don't care for it.  I don't want to drink sugary Mexican Cokes or beer, and I'd like to have something fizzy instead of just water.  Sucks for me at Diablo Burger.

I also don't really like the community seating, but we go at times when it doesn't matter.  I wouldn't enjoy eating elbow to elbow with a stranger though if that turned out to be necessary.  The seating itself looks like it would be uncomfortable (no back support for those of us with bad backs), but it's surprisingly ok and reasonably comfortable.  The rest of the restaurant decor is kinda boring, but clean.

The service is a little awkward and not highly attentive, but then again when you're just given a carafe of water that you serve yourself out of, there's not much for them to do.  They don't really talk much though, which is a little bit odd.  It adds to the boring feeling of the entire atmosphere.

The prices are slightly high, but not so bad, in my opinion.  The food is fresh.  You have to be willing to pay more if you want fresh food, otherwise establishments will cut corners so they can make a profit.  That's not what most of us want, and if you do, just go to Chili's.

Diablo Burger isn't perfect, but they're really good.  All of my gripes are minor.  My true testament to how good their food is is that me, the not-a-burger-fan, finishes the entire Diablo burger.  They're good, go give them a try!",2014-03-24 21:24:45

The burgers are very similar to steak and shake but very inconsistent on the meat.  They aren't shaped patties, more like flat pieces of meat that fall apart and a double is about the size of a 1/3 pound burger if I'm being generous.  I tried the sourdough melt and sent it back to have it remade since it wasn't sourdough bread.  They just use white bread toasted and call it sourdough.  The second time I just ate it even though it was still white bread, it wasn't worth trying again to have them realize it wasn't sourdough bread.  

They bring the food to your table which is a nice touch.  Chili cheese fries get extremely soggy quick, but the chili has a nice flavor to it.  The custard is very thick, definitely around dairy queen thickness and has a pretty decent flavor.  I've tried a couple of them and they were ok, nothing special.  

They have walleye which I haven't tried yet but have missed it, I had it up north.  Hoping it will be good, but we'll see on another trip.

once they checked on our table and i mentioned my error for ordering this item, and that i was not going to be eating the remainder of the roll, the server tried to remedy the situation by knocking off a buck or two from the roll price, since i only ate one piece. he did however make it clear that it would be difficult to remove it from the bill completely as the owner was around, and the owner would say that since i had eaten a piece, i could not have hated it. so i suppose i should have spit it out onto the plate to the dismay of my friends.

The sandwich was hot and fresh, but I found it to be bland and uninspiring. My daughter ordered a salad which came in a HUGE bowl. Both she and my mother in law had to take home leftovers. My wife ordered the pizza margherite and enjoyed it. My son ordered Mac and cheese, which he picked out about 1/5 of it that was too burned and crunchy for him to eat.

I asked if there were any choices that would avoid a lot of fat. She said that the beef is boiled so that would be a bad choice. And the chicken meat is from a fatty part of the chicken.

So, I opted for the vegan version. The vegan ""chicken"" managed to have the flavor and consistency of chicken fat! The only way I could eat it was to remind myself that it is really just tofu with that horrid texture.

The vegetables were mostly just overcooked cabbage. No broccoli or any other tasty vegetables. Under that was white rice.

If you are desperate for food in Isla Vista you might be OK eating here. Right now many of the restaurants are closed so I was desperate for something new.

I will add that as I was leaving a young man sat with his butt on the table where I had just been eating. I seriously doubt that there was anyone to wipe the table down after he left. I did not count that in my rating, but it was a bit unsettling.",2021-07-25 18:25:21

I eat some bread and a few chunks of chicken from the salad while I wait.

Downstairs got a little crowded (since I don't think they had a DJ upstairs until later in the night). The bartenders were a little strict about drink limits but seemed to relax as the night went on. If we went back next year I would buy one of the cheaper New Years tickets. Everyone else seemed to get exactly the same thing that we did at the higher ticket price (with the exception of the gift cards).

The location of this place is prime, if you're walking around Center City and I'm sure that drives the foot traffic.  We stopped in on a Friday just around lunch time.  I was feeling more like lunch than breakfast so I went with the veggie burger.  When it arrived, it definitely hit one of my burger pet peeves in that the pattie was way smaller than the bun.  I ended up having to rip off a good portion of it just to make it a worthwhile sandwich.  My partner in crime got the vegan french toast and I noticed a distinct saltiness to it which i wasn't sure was intentional or not.  Either way, I wasn't thrilled.

I found the service to be a touch lackluster as compared to other establishments in the neighborhood.  We found ourselves a few times really hunting for our waitress just for a refill on water.  My coffee was pretty decent which bumps up the star rating a little bit in my mind.

The thing I like about Triumph is that it's decently stylish and they are making their own beer right there.  You gotta love that.  It also smells very clean when you walk in.  They must keep those fermenters very sanitized.

When I lived in Jersey (which I feel like was eons ago) I used to go to the Triumph in Princeton alot.  Similar food but a very different layout/feel to it.  I like the one in Olde City because it just works well for the space.  I like their hummus platter and their tuna tartare.  Actually their tuna tartare was awesome.  I could have eaten way more of it.

The beers are very hit or miss in my opinion.  I did enjoy their pumpkin ale this weekend and their dry irish stout is one of the best in my opinion.  Very roasty and not heavy.  Mid range ABV, making it a nice session beer.  I don't like their lagers normally so I avoid them.  I've also found their IPAs to use hops that I am not fond of.  Still, this doesn't stop me from coming back.

I'm happy triumph is there as a destination in Olde City.  It has consistency and it's a great spot for weekend lunch.  I'm not sure I would pick it as a dinner destination, but I like how it's always in the back of my mind if I'm in the neighborhood.",2010-10-06 12:54:03

We paid for a $25 entree, half of which our waiter accidentally pitched in the trash, refused to give us more, and wouldn't take anything off our bill.  Absurd.  

They told us they served until 10:30, so we ordered dinner at 10 pm.  They put so much pressure on us to leave at 10:25 that we just asked them to box my husband's half eaten meal to finish at home.  (My risotto looked like a plate of vegetarian vomit and didn't taste much better so I skipped on the take out.)  My husband was brought a box with his buffolo medallions.  The waiter had thrown out the other half of his meal - a huge mound of greens and black eyed peas.  We asked if they could give us some other sides since we paid for a full meal and they threw out more than half.  The waiter said no, all the food was put away.  I asked him to take something off the bill.  He said he could take a $2 substitution charge off the bill but he couldn't take anything else off because he already ran the bill.  No logic here.  Why can you take off $2 but nothing more?

We live in the neighborhood.  My husband has eaten here many times and had good service.  Clearly this waiter just wanted to get the hell out at the end of his shift.  I understand completely.  I would too.  So either don't seat us and say kitchen is closed, seat us at the bar, or at least refund some of our money when you throw our food in the trash by accident.

Yelp really makes having certain criteria to stick with easy. 5 stars is the best, so that's perfect, 1 star is the lowest, so nothing good can be said about it, and 3 stars is average.

When I think about my time at 55 South, it was below average for a few reasons. 

First, the seating we had was not well thought out. It is right by the door, looking out the window, and that falls on the bartender. It was not her fault in my opinion because that should be a normal waiter, She had to walk all the way out of her normal area to come to us, and never got notified we were seated. So it took a solid 15 min for us to even get water. 

We stopped in at brunch, and obviously on Sunday in downtown Franklin it was packed. wait was only 20 min, but we were hungry. The menu options are not bad, but there are very minimal good options if you want to stay somewhat healthy.

My wife ordered the hot chicken sandwich, and I got oysters and deviled eggs. BIG issue with the oysters. They were not cut off the scallop yet, so it was tough to get them out of the shell. poor execution. The sandwich looked super simple and had no uniqueness. Wife only ate half. The eggs were decent, but again nothing special. We had potatoes as a side, some story.

This place is more of a bar type atmosphere, and for a brunch spot I know there are better options in Franklin. Will definitely try somewhere else next time! Below average for me overall.",2021-10-23 21:49:47

Off the bat I'll admit as others have pointed out that the service isn't great. But that never really seems to bother me. They took our order, delivered our food hot and ready and kept our water glasses full. 

The appetizers were a little disappointing - the naan wasn't anything special and I honestly couldn't tell any of the 3 varieties apart. But they were quick to give us more dipping sauces without us even asking which was nice. The Taj platter was also meh - it had a few pieces of what essentially were chicken tenders and a few pieces of what appeared to be chicken vindaloo wings. I assumed it would have more variety but that's on me for not checking what was in it with the waiter.

The entrees however were incredible. The Lamb Biryani was delicious and used cinnamon really well. The Goa Jhinga had just the right level of spice that played really well with the coconut milk.

Fun and confusing decor inside but a great conversation piece. Pretty big with multiple rooms so seating is not usually an issue except for brunch on weekends (like everywhere else). 

Only thing I would improve upon is service. While they are super friendly, the wait times to be served and for the food to come to your table can be extensive.

I had the chicken noodle soup which was mostly noodles, but it had good flavor. It needed to have a better balance between noodles, carrots, chicken and I didn't see the celery. Our waitress said it's made different each time. Chefs...it needs to have a balance. The rolls are not fresh. I think they were either frozen or bagged in. They were warm so great job on doing that. We had the fried pickles which were fresh and came with a nice dipping sauce. I had the Grilled Grouper and twiced baked potato. The fish was a little over cooked, but better than it being raw. The interior needs a severe make over. Gordon Ramsay should come do a make over on his show 24'hours to hell and back. They make some of their desserts in house.

I'd rate my experience 3.5, so I'm rounding up to 4 stars.   

To start off, the Point Judith Calamari is a good appetizer. The calamari was perfectly prepared and a little Asian sauce complimented the taste. It came with a Sweet Chili Sauce and Candied Cashews as well as bean sprouts, thinly spliced carrot strips, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It was yummy tasting, crispy, crunchy, lightly fried with a golden crust...just the way it should be made!

For lunch, I decided on the Chilean Sea Bass and it was supposed to be made with with glazed carrots (didn't have a glaze on it and tasted plain), mashed potatoes, and champagne truffle sauce (the flavor was not evident at all). The best part about the sea bass was the authentic flavors; it was very simple and tasted really good. The fish was not dry at all and if you are someone who doesn't want their fish drenched in a sauce due to not being able to taste it, this would be a good dish to try. I do think the idea was to keep it basic and let the natural flavor of the fish take over. I think it was cooked in pepper and salt. At least that's what I tasted and unfortunately I couldn't taste the champagne truffle sauce or else it was very, very light. The carrots and peas were chopped and lightly sautéed, leaving a crunchy bite, but nothing about it left me wanting to take another bite. If I wanted to have carrots cooked that way, I'd simply cook at home instead of going out. I think the star of the dish was the fish, but it does have a somewhat strong fish flavor if you don't eat fish often. The sides that came with the fish did fall short on presentation and taste, so that was disappointing. If you want to enhance your taste buds and can't do that when you alternate between a bite of sea bass and your sides, don't be disappointed. Let's be frank, the sides are so ordinary and boring that I had to add salt and pepper to enhance it. I will say this, the sea bass is positively delicious and mild enough that other people who are not fans of fish would learn to appreciate it, even if they do not like seafood. The way the dish was presented, it's main focus was on the sea bass and the sides didn't get much attention at all. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a lunch dish for $29 should be better composed than what was showcased, but don't let it stop you from coming back to try other dishes. I do need to come during Happy Hour Mon. - Fri. from 4:00pm - 6:00 pm where you get 1/2 off selected appetizers. $8 cucumber gimlet, strawberry smash and pine fin cocktails.",2017-03-26 19:51:35

HOT WINGS ARE A GIRLS BEST FRIEND (5/5): David prepared them for us & they're baked beforehand and dropped in the fryer for 6 min. for a crispy exterior w/Bourbon BBQ sauce that is sweet.

LOVE GALORE (4.5/5): They are pretty big - could've been better hot vs. warm upon delivery w/a dash of sweet pepper jelly (no heat or spice, even though the menu states it).

Can we talk about the gorgeous mural they have in the back of the restaurant?

There's also a club next door. I love Happy Hour, which starts @$7 & includes small bites & cocktails on Wed. - Fri. From 3-7pm!

My only recommendation is to amp up the heat on dishes that are considered spicy. 

Overall 4 - 4.5/5!

Formerly my favorite restaurant in Indianapolis, the old owners are gone and the new cooks--whether they are using the prior owners' recipes or not--are not up to par. 

Food that was once juicy, tantalizing, flavorful are now watered down, recycled too often/long in the buffet slots and lacks the flavors that once lured me there and had me sending tons of people their way. They used to have the best, creamiest hummus in town--no longer.  They used to have an eggplant dish that would convert non-eggplant eaters into advocates--that's gone, too. 

They even replaced the awesome exotic iced tea with one of those crap Lipton machines. 

The only reason they get to even keep 2 stars (down from 5) is that the at least have yet to screw up the rice pudding and coconut  cake.

SIMPLE LITTLE PLACE
With just a few hastily added tables and mostly unadorned walls, this place feels pretty new and pretty temporary. Currently the menu is written on poster boards in a regular black sharpie and a handful of Banh Mi variations as well as a score of Boba types are offered. In locations like this I prefer to grab-n-go rather than dine in so that's what I've done.

GREAT BANH MI DECENT BOBA
MmMmMm the Bread is excellently crispy and flaky--you won't be able to eat that cleanly--and perfectly cradles the goodies inside. So far whether it's the special or the Pork the flavors inside make me imagine I've stepped into a family's kitchen and this is what they've prepared for me. 

Unfortunately the Boba drinks are more on the powder/flavor icy side--never as good as using brewed Tea bases or flavors from the real Fruit. And so far my slushies haven't been blended very well with larger ice chunks floating around.

GREAT PRICES ON THE GO

No matter where you sit you are guaranteed a fabulous view of the waterfront. The restaurant is perched partially over the water and the seating further away from the shore is elevated allowing an unobstructed view. Our server also made sure we knew that any fish we were going to eat was still alive and swimming earlier that day--a perk from their relationships with those who fished the nearby waters. The would make a great date place because the environment itself would give enough things to talk about but families would also enjoy here because it's not very stuffy and dim.

FOOD PAIRED WITH SERVICE
My Thai Coconut Red Curry on the market fish was very mild in all spices. This allowed the subtle bay flavor of the Fish itself to not get drowned in what are typically strong spices. The presentation of using a whole fish UPRIGHT was also very pretty. We also had a dish containing a Cedar Planked Salmon. Tuna Medallion Skewer, and a Grouper Cake--each time the Fish flavor wasn't drowned out but wasn't boring bland either. The server was very attentive and made additional comments about everything without being annoying.",2014-08-07 18:24:29

Perhaps it's because of our visit during dinner on a weeknight, or maybe even the choices of the Sushi chefs were questionable, but most of the choices on the conveyor belt were not appealing visually. Out of 23 plates my group ate, only three of those came from the belt (all Seaweed Salads) the rest were ordered directly from the servers.
 
THE FOOD WAS JUST OKAY
Some of our orders included Octopus Takoyaki, Salmon Nigiri, Seafood Udon Soup, Chicken Kara Age... honestly none of them impressed me. The Takoyaki relied heavily on sauces- the sauces could've been covering anything and it would've tasted the same. The Salmon Nigiri and Udon Soup were good- at least they didn't over season either of those; the original flavors still showed but were very toned down. Even the Sushi Roll plates we ordered were lacking in flavor.

AND IT ADDS UP
Even though each plate costs $3.50/ea or less, it adds up (Ex: each Sushi plate typically contains only four pieces). Then consider that much of the food had a quasi 'left out' taste. It was a good experience and the servers were friendly, but probably not an experience we would repeat.",2017-02-22 02:32:28

FOOD
Sounds crazy, but the food tasted like some Thai Grandma was in the kitchen cooking it specifically for me (while her son makes the plate look pretty) The proteins were cooked well and not overwhelmed by any of the seasoning. Vegetables tasted fresh. Thai food done wrong can easily get drowned in strong spices, but this place keeps afloat.

SERVICE
What? An Asian restaurant with Asian servers who actually show personality? There was a lot of smiles... however... THEY ARE SO SO SO SLOW. Timing was totally off despite having all servers' hands on deck. It was slow service before a server initially helped us, slow to filling water glasses, slow to bringing food out and getting the bill.

We made a reservation for 12:30 on a Sunday. I was the first to arrive (not fashionably late enough I guess) and held down the fort while I waited for our table. Apparently the hostess told me to follow her upstairs but I'm literally so retarded I didn't hear her say that, so I continued to wait downstairs. Thank goodness one of my friends arrived and we waited together. 

We were shortly brought upstairs and seated. Hostess warned us that they suddenly became super busy and that it would take a minute (5 min) for our server to arrive. It actually took much longer and I told a bus boy or some shit to get the waitress over. She arrived and apologized for the wait, mentioning that it was her first day. 

My friend was very keen on the Gallo Pinto, the Costa Rican one (eggs, rice/beans, peppers, lizano sauce, fried cheese, avocado, plantains, meat). She said it's the rice in the middle of it that's the shit. I was also intrigued by this ""lizano sauce"". Like what the fuck is that shit? I'm picturing a light green color. It also has fried cheese. Fried cheese? Are you fucking kidding me?

Anyways they gave a whole bunch of things that intrigued me. A whole bunch of platters with like eggs, and meat in some form, and like rice in some form with various other things like beans and guac and platanos (""I'm just flying up some platanos right now""). 

I was also torn between that and the mexican (refried black beans, pico de gallo, eggs, queso fresco, tomatillo sauce, chorizo, home fries and avocado). I ultimately went with this one for onion reasons, but my two friends ordered the cuban one so I figured I would be able to have a taste.

When the waitress finally came over, mah gurl and I ordered bloody marys (ugh, classic). They gave us this delicious like fried or some shit bread slices and it was SO good. I couldn't resist having like...three.  

I ordered the mexican without meat and when it came, it classically had meat in it. This has been happening to me excessively lately. I didn't realize after taking a bite. I told them and they quickly came out with another one. It was pretty good! Unfortunately that's when the bloody mary and the mango mimosas I ordered afterwards had kicked in thoroughly so I can't provide more specifics than that. 

Bloody mary as one of the better ones that I've had in my life at restaurants. The mimosas were also super good, they come in a variety of flavors.

Ultimately the food was good and the offerings are unique. Sure, they have classics like omelettes and pancakes and shit but I look forward to coming back and trying some of their other shit.",2017-09-12 21:26:52

I'd first heard of this place from Tony Bruno on ESPN Radio. After hearing all his comments about the broccoli rabe and reading all the reviews, I was primed to eat here.

They actually have two Tony Luke's, one's a sit outside/order at a window type deal and the other is what looks like a sit down restaurant across the street. I came around noon and ordered from the sidewalk/order at the window joint. 

I got the roast pork italian, which has sharp provolone and your choice of spinach or broccoli rabe(I got the rabe). I also got an order of fries.  The sandwich came out relatively fast along with the fries. There was a mixup on my soda, but I got it, so no harm no foul.  I sat down at one of the aluminium tables next to the order window with my sandwich. The roast pork sandwich was so so good. The combination of the provolone and the broccoli rabe really complimented the tender pork slices.  My mouth is starting to water again just reading about it. The fries were not too bad and there were plenty of them. I""m not sure whether they were breaded or it was the potatoes they used, but it seemed a little different.  Next time I think I'll get the onion rings. 

I did have one beef with Tony Luke's. I wasn't happy however with the cleanliness of the eating area and on top of that there were multiple flies buzzing around. I know that you can't completely wipe out mother nature, but I can't help but think if they'd cleaned the place and took out the garbage more often that maybe there wouldn't have been so many flies.

Overall I enjoyed the food. I'll come back and take the sandwiches back home.

But since there hasn't been any Mexican joint worth speaking of west of the Schuykill, I was eager to try it.

The chips and salsa were pretty decent. The salsa was more like the El Jarocho red salsa crema, flavorful and spicy without being too hot. The guacamole we ordered was also pretty decent. I was annoyed at having to pay for chips and salsa, but at least it wasn't too expensive. I would like to have gotten more than a small side sauce container full of sauce though.

My g/f got a vegetarian torta and I got enchiladas verdes with chicken. The chicken was pretty moist and of decent quality. The verdes sauce however was pretty lifeless. I couldn't taste the tang of the tomatillos, nor much cilantro, garlic, or onion for that matter. There wasn't an aluminum  or metal tang to the sauce, so it probably wasn't made from canned tomatillos. It was probably just a sauce kept in the refrigerator a little too long. My g/f's torta was full of vegetables and queso fresco cheese. She liked it, though I wasn't that impressed from the bite or two that I had. 

The churros were hot and seemed like they had been made recently. Delicious. The sopapilla like tortilla with cinnamon and sugar was also decent, though a little overpowdered with sugar and cinnamon. 

The atmosphere was pretty warm and inviting. There were a couple of tables to sit if you wanted to to dine in, though I could imagine it getting packed r.eal quickly on a weekend night.

The service was pretty good overall and the owner was pretty nice. He apologized for not having horchata, but said that they would have it soon.

Overall I wasn't that impressed, but I think maybe it was just an off night for them based on the previous reviews and the smells emanating from the other peoples plates. The tacos that the two drunk guys behind me had smelled delicious. I'll probably be back to give it another go.",2012-03-01 03:07:36

1. The Food
-PYT is a burger joint or at least says its a burger joint. I like burgers, so much so that I gained the moniker I currently use.  So I came here last night and had the BBQ Bacon Bleu burger.  Bacon, blue cheese, and BBQ. Sounds good, right? I thought so when I ordered it.  The burger came out within a reasonable time frame with onion straws on top and onion rings(I asked to have a substitute for the fries, since my Yelp friend Christopher R said the onion rings were good). The burger itself was neither real big circumference wise, but it was fairly thick. The hamburger bun(I never get why East Coasters say roll for everything) had a lot of sesame seeds on it. The burger was fairly juicy upon first bite. However, it was less medium and more medium rare which was annoying, but not unexpected. Few places seem to do medium right.  The blue cheese was piled up in the center of the burger and was pretty strong. I almost didn't realize what it was when I first got it. I'm not sure whether they crumbled blue cheese in the middle and let it melt or they used pasteurized blue cheese spread. It just looked a little strange. And it tasted a little strange The bacon was very crispy, kudos for that. I realized later that I didn't taste any BBQ, so I""m wondering where that came in. There certainly wasn't any sauce and the burger didn't taste like it had been on an outdoor grill.

The onion rings were a disappointment. The breading was light and crisp but the onions themselves were soggy.

My chocolate shake was decent but nothing memorable. It tasted like mediocre store bought ice cream(And it kinda tasted like vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup, though I could be wrong).

2. The service-From the time I opened the door I was greeted and seated immediately.  My server came within the first 5 minutes(which is the longest I'll wait for service, knowing that places with shitty service start out by taking forever to get to you). She was nice, attentive, helped me with my order and got me my check pretty fast.  Exactly what you want from a waitress.

Based on my food experience, I""m not sure I'd come back. I definitely have had better burgers for 12 bucks(Yes that did include onion rings, so its not so bad, but still its a burger place. You think they'd kill every burger they made).  I kinda wished I'd gotten the cheesesteak pretzel burger but I went for something a little more normal.

Service was really good. However I will add I went early on a Thursday evening. So I have no idea how service holds up at more popular/frequented times.",2010-02-06 06:25:41

I've put off writing a review because I hate to publish bad reviews. But, as I thought about it more, I came to the conclusion that I should write an honest review.

Since it was a birthday party, there were several people at the table.  It was my first time meeting some of them. I noticed a big issue with my water, but initially didn't say anything. I didn't want to make a scene and ruin the guy's birthday party. I looked around the table and saw that other people had this issue as well. I finally spoke up. There were roach legs floating in our waters. I brought it to the attention of our waitress. The only thing she did about it was get us new waters. She didn't even apologize. 

I have to be real here. This is New Orleans. There are roaches everywhere in this city. It is what it is. You get used to it. Don't think its something specific to New Orleans now. I've lived in other coastal Southern cities where there were issues with roaches. The problem in this situation is that the waitress did nothing about it other than bring more waters. She didn't even apologize. It would have made the situation better if she had done something about it. Maybe a complimentary appetizer, complimentary dessert, or comp the entire meal. Just do something.

Two advantages over the other places I've tried: 1) there is indoor seating at a counter (although it's very limited) and 2) the spicy peppers and other condiments were inside rather than sitting out at the curbside in the hot sun.

Online it says they close at 9, but I called to make sure and they said 8. I got there at 7:30, but the servers were still very cheery and friendly, not to mention, a big group came outside from the inside bar. They seemed like regulars and more people showed up at 8, so I think the hours vary based on if anyone is around. 

I ate by myself outside, and ordered a to go for my husband. I splurged on the ribeye ($25) because it looked good on the menu and on here. Asked for it to be medium rare, and it came out medium well, in part, the steak was  fairly thin, so I'm sure its hard to cook rare. It was very reminiscent of when I worked at Jerry's as a teen, and the Sysco steaks the line cooks would make for me in style, taste and texture, but wasn't tender at all, and had no flavor. I asked a server for Heinz, but she never returned. I did mention that I was unhappy with the steak, but I wasn't looking for comps because I was still going to eat it. But the server did take off my $7 bloody mary which was unexpected and nice. 

I got the special salad, of the sesame crusted halibut for Cory to go, and he said the fish was excellent, and a good sized portion, even though there was too much salad for the meat. But overall, he said his was great.

Turns out Cory wasn't quite as big of a fan as I was, but I'm the yelper so my opinion is the only one that matters.... hasn't anyone seen our Southpark episode?

Now, I came alone one day after work and had a good experience, although I didn't stuff my face so I felt like I couldn't give an accurate review yet. I was the only customer for a long time so I talked with the owner Tony a lot, and that was really one of the major selling points in my first visit. I did try the saba, it is house cured, but I'm just too American in my tastes and still have a hard time eating this one because the fishy flavor is so potent. I liked Tony for the fact he didn't have any sort of grudge or ""holier than though"" attitude about the American palette for sushi and he seems just excited to be operating this business. He is from Korea and has cooked and been a sushi chef for about 15 years, all over the world and somehow landed here.  

Anyways fast forward, Cory is in town and is letting me pick the sushi place. The entire menu is included here at lunch, it's one of my favorite things I look for in our local sushi restaurants now. I start with mussels, there are 3 kinds, regular, one baked with the white sauce, and deep fried, I did baked. Then we started on the rolls. Both visits it wasn't busy so Tony and Jose said they don't mind making half rolls when it is slow. Jose was our chef today and I noticed he is looking at the menu a lot, and asking the other chef (who isnt Tony) lots of questions. Turns out it was his first day and had just started 3 hours ago. You could tell he wasn't a new to sushi chef, he has worked at 3 other places in Reno. Him and I talk about the reno sushi scene and eventually he asks if I am a chef (HA!), which little did he known is like the best compliment I've received in months... I told him I just sushi too much!

We tried a lot of rolls, I actually like the deep fried rolls here because they are so crunchy. The Panko has jalapeño and I added lemon inside, it was almost popper like. I loved my Lemon Time roll, that's where I discovered they do a lemon sauce, which isn't on many other places menus. Cory had the Yosemite, the menu doesn't say it's topped with mango sauce, maybe it was an Jose improvisation. I liked it, but I only had a couple bites, it was too much for him, a couple drizzles would have been better, but it was pretty covered. Cory ordered the Cacti roll too, with deep fried jalepeno slices, also one I enjoyed, but didn't eat a lot of. Cory would have liked it more as probably a 1/2 roll. Lastly I did the Zodiac, I like bbq tuna, but Cory apparently doesn't (again, liar), only thing I would change is the crunch, I like crunch in my rolls. 

We left and I was beyond happy, I feel like the rolls are different than what else is offered around town. Granted I can't comment on nigiri as much, as I didn't order it here. There are a variety of sauces, which I am in love with the lemon sauce. Cory got to the car and felt it was just okay, which bummed me out, because I thought we had a new favorite, but I guess it's just mine :)",2016-01-25 22:07:29

The chicken was adequately spiced but could have used a bit more sauce.  The rice was topped with some almonds, and was pretty good.

I went for the Mediterranean portobello burger for a change of pace since I'd had a regular burger before. It was decent, not anything to write home about, I thought the onions weren't well cooked and the burger lacked substance. I will probably go back for one of their regular beef burgers next time. The fries were great, always very well made. The drink I got was a cyan mojito - on the plus side it's always nice to find mojitos on cocktail menus so I'm glad of that but it was a Strong mojito so I had to wait for ice to dilute a little before I could enjoy it.

So yes there was a wait once I got there even after using the online waitlist. Yes Sabrina's is small, tight and loud. Which I kind of guessed for such a popular place and from reading other reviews.

The servers were friendly, we had extremely fast service. We ordered the tuna blt and the spinach omelette. My boyfriend thought his spinach omelette was just okay. A little to fluffy. Like an airy omelette. He liked the famous breakfast potatoes a lot. He was kind of thrown off about his toast just being plain. With no offer of butter for it. I kind of understood. My tuna blt was just okay. I wished that the bread didn't fall apart and the big no flavor tomato slices were cut thinner. I took them off. I enjoyed my sweet potato fries, partially because the sprinkled powdered sugar on them. 

Our bill can to a little over $30. I'm not sure it was worth it. I can't say I'd be in a rush to go back but I would to maybe try some of the other offerings. Maybe when there is a chance of being less crowded...and when I don't have to pay for parking, lol.",2019-01-31 13:16:39

He said yes and we just asked him to take it out completely feeling irritated that he didn't just say that in the first place.

The De La Casa Margarita is awful. It tastes like a straight mix. I asked the waiter if he could change it to The Skinny Margarita that the other person got and he said ""Yes, I will dump a little of this out and put some of that mix in it""....Not what I asked. Still tasted bad.

I've been in search of new tiki bar since the Upstairs Bar closed down, and Tiki is in a convenient location in Midtown Village, so I checked it out with a friend when we needed a spot to catch up and hang out.

We ordered the Scallion Pancakes and Dumplings as a snack, and the bartender pulled them out of frozen packages and cooked them like that. So basically, I just paid money for like, microwaveable food.  They also served them in like, take out paper containers you'd get at a fair and with take out packets of soy sauce and duck sauce which we just sadly squirted out on top of our food.  I was embarrassed for them, to be honest.

The drinks were really uninteresting - I ordered the Riki Tiki Tavi because it seemed palatable out of most of the drinks and it was dull.  Tasted like somewhat bitter soda water with a dash of citrus and some alcohol.  Yikes.  I honestly could have mixed something very similar during my college days.  

On top of all of that, the smell? The bar smelled like a mix of skunk, sweat, and gas.  

Our bartender was sweet, but I'm truly sorry, nothing can truly save this place or the experience.

BOTTOM LINE: SKIP THIS PLACE. Midtown is FULL of gems, and this is unfortunately the dud in the midst.  The food and drinks weren't even worth taking photos of, I was so, so disappointed.",2019-10-10 15:56:51

If I have to enter into Fennario's...which entails parting a sea of chain-smoking, skinny-jeaned, tousled, dirty-looking young things of indeterminate age huddled outside the entrance, it's because a friend of mine's band has a gig or someone has an art show on the 2nd floor. As their live music acts go, some are interesting, most not. (I'll remain mum on which category said friend's performance falls under)

The interior of the place has an unkempt, derelict look about it, and more often than not one of West Chester's resident bums is spotted reclining in his own pungency near the back. I'm assuming the baristas have control over the music, because the music choices are really schizo: one occasion you'll hear (and appreciate) the low-key drawl and hum of an indie rap song quietly mingling with the dankness of the cafe...or on another occasion, you'll be assaulted by a blaring cacophonous techno mix of, say, Barbie Girl, that drowns out any and every rational thought.

   ---   ---   ---

Maybe I'm a tough critic because the only other Brazilian Steakhouse I've been to is supposedly one of the best in the country - Chama Gaucha in Houston. I don't remember how much my meal was there, but everything was so delicious, that I would have had no issue paying any amount of money for it. 

Bull Grill was a step down from that, for me. And there's nothing wrong with not being as good as one of Yelp's Top 100 restaurants in the country, but here's my beef (no pun intended.)

-The meat was generally solid, but not spectacular.

-The salad bar was very underwhelming (again, compared to a place with 3-4x the selection.)

-The cost was $120 for two people after tax/tip for two dinners and sodas.

Both my fiance and I walked out with the same opinion - a fun experience that's definitely different from the norm... but $120? Phew. To be honest, I would not return at kind of price point.

I don't enjoy giving negative, or in this case, a ""meh"" review for a local business that is obviously pouring their heart and soul into a business. At the same time, I also want to be honest in giving my opinion. 

I will say this - everyone working here during our visit could not have been nicer. Service was incredibly prompt and always with a smile. We appreciated that very much.",2016-01-27 02:02:16

So tonight, we came here because we had a gift card.  Like I said previously, I generally do well with Ruby Tuesdays.  The one I go to in Malvern near work has generally treated me well.  I usually appreciate the salad bar.  Some items on the menu can be pretty good, especially the appetizers and burgers.  Like a lot of chains, if you go into the entree world, it's hit or miss.  

Before I go anywhere, let me state that none of this review is indicative of the level of service by our waiter, Brian.  He was very good.  I made it a point to name him because I know that everything else isn't his fault.  

Now, on to the grievances.  

So, my first mistake was coming in here expecting to get something I wanted as a paying customer.  Case in point... order the Chicken Trio, and ask them to substitute the rice pilaf for another side such as mashed cauliflower.  You see, this particular item on the menu is stated that it is served with rice pilaf on the menu.  If you get the salad bar with it, you do not get another choice of side.  Apparently the three pieces of chicken must be served on a bed of rice pilaf.  This is a rule.  Don't question it.  It has been deemed so by the corporate suits who own the Ruby Tuesday empire!

You see, in my naive head, being the paying customer, it seems to me that you can just serve the chicken on the plate without the rice, and put some cauliflower on the side or in a separate dish.  Well, my server was nice enough to ask the kitchen if they would do it at least.  But he seemed mildly unsure if they would accommodate the request.  

I never managed a restaurant in my life.  But I have to imagine some requests, if simple, should be honored.  It's not like I was asking them for a more expensive side.  It's not like I was asking them to change the flavoring radically.  It's not like I'm Meg Ryan ordering dinner in When Harry Met Sally here.  I just wanted cauliflower instead of rice.  

The server came back out, and he told me the kitchen couldn't do it.  Apparently he told me they said it has to be served over a bed of rice pilaf.  He asked if I wanted to order a completely different entree instead.  

Well, since I really wanted the variety of chicken, and I just didn't feel like making a scene, I took the rice.  You see, perhaps I could have asked for a manager, but sometimes you just don't want to fight the battle in the restaurant.  Because in the end I have a simple credo.

Always Yelp about it later... that's the best ammunition!

So anyway, I imagine the conversation in the kitchen went like this...

SERVER: Hey, a customer wants the Chicken Trio with cauliflower instead of rice.  Can you do that for him?  

20 YEAR OLD COOK WHO ISN'T TRAINED WELL: W-w-w-w-w-whaaattt???  Ummmm, I don't know how to do that.  The menu says rice pilaf.  I can't ignore the menu.  The menu says so.  Can't go against the menu.  

SERVER: So you're going to send me back out there to tell the customer no, then?

COOK: *head explodes from the pressure*

I mean, if you're Georges Perrier, and you have lived your whole life learning about food and you win major awards in France for doing so, then you get to tell me how you will serve your dish.  Otherwise, give me my damn cauliflower and hush.  

So anyway, now that my rant is done... that Chicken Trio does indeed come on a bed of rice pilaf, a HUUGGGEEE bed of rice, with three pieces of chicken the size of two of my fingers each.  

You know, I really think they could have just moved the damn chicken over, saved the rice, and thrown some cauliflower on there.  It's not like real estate on the plate was at a premium.  These weren't large chicken pieces here.  

I know... I'm ranting.  And there are far greater injustices in the world.  But for some reason, this kind of soured me.  

Oh by the way, the dish I got wasn't too bad in the end.  But my wife's dish... for 12 bucks she gets a scrawny cajun chicken breast, three overcooked shrimp on a wood skewer, and sliced tomatoes.  The tomatoes were bigger than the other two items on the plate combined.  The flavoring on her chicken tasted bitter.  She couldn't even get the shrimp off of the skewer, it was stuck on there since it was so overcooked.  Literally, she tried to pull the shrimp off and the stick broke from the pressure.  The tomatoes were the only good thing on her dish.  Bottom line... one dish failed out of two.  

I just have to say this to the Ruby's kitchen... if you had just given me the cauliflower like I asked, I'd have kept this place at three stars and not updated my review.  But you compelled me to mock you after this experience tonight.  This failure is on the kitchen staff.  They just didn't know what they were doing tonight.  

Next time I get a gift card for Ruby's, I'll just drive to Malvern to use it.",2013-01-19 02:52:24

This place has been on my radar to try for a while.  Got my chance for lunch yesterday.  Apparently I was fortunate to come at a down time after 1 because it wasn't terribly busy.  According to the waitress, they were packed a half hour prior.  So I was able to get lightning fast service.  

I, like many others, have my yardsticks that I measure Jewish delis by.  I have standard things I like to try.   For me, it's about the matzoh ball soup and the knish.  The sandwiches are important as well, but those two dishes in particular will make or break a place for me.  

So here's my verdict...

Matzoh ball soup... not every place makes this with carrots, chicken, and celery.  This place does.  And I appreciate that.  For $3.39 it was a decent size bowl.  Not the biggest ever, but not a skimp.  Win.  

Potato knish.... now, I'll admit that I'm not a knish expert.  I just know what I like in them.  I've had knishes that had a touch of seasoning in the filling, maybe a dash of black pepper, that worked very well.  This had no seasoning whatsoever.  It was a little bland, and was mildly greasy on the outside.  And, due to microwaving I am sure, the outside was overly hot (to the point of tongue burning), while farther inside it was more cool.  Also, at $4.25, it was just not big enough.  Sorry, I have to fail this one.  

Turkey special... I've had this sandwich at several places in the local region.  it's just a combo I like.  The turkey was a generous pile, tasted fresh enough, with good flavoring in the cole slaw and dressing, and soft rye bread.  At $7.99 it was a good enough size. I've had better turkey specials that actually came with a side order unlike this one, but this was a fine sandwich.  Call this a win. 

I sampled the pickle bar.  I'm not a pickle guy.  But I give a plus for offering the bar.  

I almost hate giving it three stars because everyone who served me there was so nice and friendly.  Really, kudos on the service.  It couldn't have been better.  

Food quality, though, two of the three items were good enough to satisfy.  Judging by other experiences documented here on Yelp, I'd say this place is good enough to give a try.  But I have to call my experience as I see it.",2012-12-13 20:43:12

Positives here are that they give you a lot got your money. A BLT club with fries gives a sizable sandwich with a mound of fries. A slice of pizza was huge. The tossed salad with chicken came with plenty of it. 

Food flavor wise, nothing stood out as special. In fact, the huge slice of pizza completely lacked flavor. But the cheesesteak I tried held up ok.

But... if you're just one person on your own on a Saturday night in early November around 8pm, you will be told that you can't be seated to get something to eat.  The reason they will give is that they need the tables for the big college football game (apparently the owner is a huge Alabama fan, and it was LSU-Bama night), and they will need the tables for anyone coming over from Eastern State Penitentary.  You will then be told that you have to fight it out for a spot at the bar which no one appears to be ready to leave.  

This will make me, a potential paying customer, go somewhere else and not spend money here, probably ever again.  I understand the need for tables, but they had at least 16 spots open with small tables put together at the time I asked.

I tried a sausage slice, a buffalo chicken slice, and a piece of the pepperoni stromboli. The slices had a decent amount of toppings and were nice and foldable. I'd eat them again. The stromboli actually tasted better without the cup of sauce they gave me. That sauce was cold and lacked flavor.  I don't know if that sausage slice was made with the same sauce, but I'm going to assume not. 

If you asked me to compare, I'd come here before I went to Bravo or Nino's nearby. I'd probably choose Venice over them. I'd go to Anthony's before all of them.

I had a banquet there today, and I was more than disappointed in the food. I used to love the salmon and spinach, the chicken cannoli, fried mozzarella, fried zucchini and baked ziti. I was thoroughly disappointed. You spend $3000 for food that is ill-seasoned at best.

A few people thought the food was good, but I know how the food USED TO BE, and today's entrees were a poor version. The ziti was dry, with limited sauce and meat. The fried mozzarella had an aftertaste. the chicken cannoli's pasta was overcooked, over-cheesed, and 'under-chickened (very little chicken in the dish)! While the salmon and spinach dish was void of the light lemon taste with the delightful spinach. Instead, it was season-less, with a heavy 'in the way,' greasy sauce.

The shining Stars were our OUTSTANDING servers, Brian K. & Brendan! B&B are a team. I wondered how would banquet management put 2 servers in a banquet of 40 people...yet, other banquets had more servers. #questionable.

So,  if the price is too good to be true, there's a reason why...  then take that as your cue to run far fast. I was really looking forward to enjoying a Maryland crab cake here in Florida, but alas... I'm still on the hunt.",2017-12-16 00:11:13

They make their pizzas in a unique long shape which is easy to slice and display.  They have a vegan pizza with Daiya cheese!!!  Clean, spare, modern decor in the vibe of Chipotle.  There are five of these, four of which are in PA (Wayne, Doylestown, Newtown besides this one), one in CA.  

Eight meat pies, fifteen veggie, and four cheese.  Swap out any cheese for Daiya -- they are happy to do it, thank you!  Three thin crusts, all organic, include a white, wheat, and gluten free.  They also have cool toppings like chick peas, butternut squash, all sorts of greens, artichokes, kalamata olives, pear slices, black beans, and about 30 other things.  Large is $18.50; medium is $15.50, a dollar extra for glutenfree. Salads are $5-6.

Local organic sources; I have to ask more about this.  Kid-friendly too, great to see kids not eating total junk, and very sweet enthusiastic staff.  Order by the slice or the pie.  BYOB, and there is a wine store right over by Trader Joe's.  Wish we had one in our town.",2012-03-23 01:43:45

Staff at every turn were very friendly, even when they seemed to be overwhelmingly busy.

Note to vegans: As for the vegetarian menu, most of which heavy on eggs, cream, and cheese, you have to request the vegan customization if it is marked as being possible (with 3 stars).  Some items, however, seemed vegan according to their ingredients but weren't marked as ""can be vegan."" Why not just make the vegetarian items vegan, using nut creams and cheeses? Vegetarians will eat these, I believe. 

Yes, I could have asked more questions, but who wants to bother busy servers and bartenders? The only vegan dessert, of about 8, was sorbet. So I would not make this place my choice for an upscale dinner, but it is OK for snacks.

Our server gave us olive oil for the tasty bread, and our tofu entree with citrus and broccoli ($19) was delicious.

People here have covered the vegan fare, and this place shows that vegan food can be offered among many meat dishes, pleasing everyone even when you are with a diverse group.  

While there is not a huge array of vegan, we can order straight off the menu and can't get to everything in one night, which is always a plus.  We were stuffed splitting the Korean BBQ seitan tacos, spring rolls with a cherry compote, and the wings with tasty creamy sauces, which my husband raved and raved about.  Next time I will try the Stuffed Tofu, filled with nuts and fruit.

He wished there were more actual Belgians on draft instead of just Belgian-style.  I am not as into Belgian beer and was happy with my Sierra Nevada rye ale.  

We have come for lunch but wish we could make the brunch sometime to try the vegan creamed dried beef on toast, something I never thought I'd be eating again.  It's so cool that they make savory comfort dishes with lots of flavor and spice.  

We had a long wait late on a Friday night which was expected, but the hostess remembered us and took care of us in the time quoted   Nice that the outdoor seating is non-smoking.

This restaurant was formerly Ben Kay, where they made their own ginger dressing, served the best hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), and were the first Japanese restaurant to open an adjunct Japanese grocery in Nashville. It used to be the only place you could find fairly fresh udon and Poke sticks without trekking to K&S, which always smelled bad and had no personnel who spoke English. (Not that that's a criticism, because it is an Asian grocery, but it makes it difficult to find anything if you can't read Japanese, Chinese, or Korean signs.) 
AT any rate, Ben Kay went a bit downhill, and at some point was renamed Sonobana and I assume taken over by new owners. The staff are still friendly, the shop is still there, but the food is increasingly poor. The basics - tuna, salmon - are tired. The rice is below par; maybe its Nishiki or another good brand, but it's often dried out. The menu is enormous - it would be better if they'd concentrate on half the dishes and do them twice as well. The saddest is their salad and dressing, which tastes nothing like the previous.
Which brings me to my biggest beef about Japanese restaurants in Nashville. Why not spend the extra couple of cents a salad, and use something other than iceberg lettuce? Maybe drain the bowls so there's not a huge collection of water at the bottom? 
Oh well. There is a reason most of the reviews here date from a few years ago. This is no longer a good restaurant. More's the pity, because it's the only one in the neighborhood outside of a Sushi Train, which just opened.",2013-01-02 03:01:33

I shopped some of her favorite stores, but my reason for wanting to come was the Sperry Shoes Outlet Store. Everything else was just icing on the cake.

I may have missed a store- but that is what I can remember off hand. My sister and I made various purchases across numerous stores and went across the street for lunch. We passed the running children's train ride as we were walking between stores and there was medium foot traffic for a Thursday late morning. We hit sales- that's what you do especially when you are shopping outlets. As stated in other reviews- the Tampa Premium Outlet isn't actually in Tampa, but north of the city...

My friend had came up from Memphis on a whim, and we had a couple of dining excursion with this being the finale of his visit. 

Sunday brunch was already set in our minds to be a bit of a crazy, so the 1 hour and 15 minute wait came as no surprise. We expected it and this by no means is something to complain about when you know it is going to be that way. Consider this - East Nashville, Instagrammable dining experience both in atmosphere with food and dining room, plus everyone knowing Marché's reputation. If you don't expect a wait when coming here and then complain about it on Yelp; your Yelp review provides very little validity in my book. 

Speaking about Sunday brunch - the hostesses who were handling the seating were exceptionally nice and very great at what the did. I appreciated them not being stuffy and like we owed them something. So often, you will find yourself in a position where you are going to the hostess stand and them having some sort of pretentious attitude like we as the diners owe them something. Example - Husk. Marché didn't have this and I am grateful for it.

The kind customer service flowed over to our server, Dylan. Dylan was a super sweet guy who throughout the dining experience ensured that we were content. Except... I wasn't content. 

When the food arrived, my food came out cold. The grits had already coagulated. They had clearly been out for awhile and the eggs and turkey sausage were no better and also cold. To make matters worse, I found a hair in my food towards the end of the meal in my scrambled eggs. That was the icing on the cake. I didn't mention it to Dylan because at that point I could tell he already felt bad about the cold food which he offered to return. I declined and I just wanted to eat since we did wait for that hour and 15 minutes. I was hungry! 

At the end of the meal, he mentioned he took off my breakfast saying that was not the standard of the restaurant. I truly appreciated him in doing so. He mentioned that day must have been an off day since someone else had said that their food was cold, too, so this was not an isolated incident.

My friend enjoyed his meal. He got the omelette and we split their mediocre french toast. I wasn't blown away by it. It didn't have flavor and the syrup didn't add substance to it.

Conclusion - food sucked on this particular day and service and ambiance were amazing. Wish the food could have highlighted the experience as well.",2019-01-21 16:13:50

Rather this is more of a review of this specific location which seems to be more or less a bit depressing when visiting.

The interior, though similar with any other Five Guys locations, is sparse, less clean, and not as inviting as other locations (lighting maybe?). Also, the service here was not so great to barely passable. I could imagine myself being served at McDonald's or Wendy's.

Though I drove out 20 mins to come here, I'd probably opt to go to another Five Guys a bit further away for a better Five Guys dining experience.

And trust me, 99.5% of all of the Chinese restaurants I've been to in America is absolute shit. And I'm not even counting the Panda Expresses or the all-you-can-eat buffet garbage because that's not even Chinese. I don't know what that is.

Anyhow, my cousin was raving about this place and quite honestly, I DID NOT want to go here. I don't care how many people loved this place, I felt as if I could never find good Chinese food in America. But I've got to admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.

Granted, not everything was good here but their Peking Duck was pretty spot on. With the spring onions, the dipping sauce and duck flavoring. Their lobster was just ok.

Most of their servers speak horrible English so they're going to have a hard time understanding what you're ordering. I should've done the ordering instead of my cousin since I speak Mandarin but considering I really wasn't stoked on eating the food from here, I thought I'd let him get upset about it. Lol. I'm such an asshole.

Ok, so this place is really crowded and even though there's a parking lot, we found trouble finding a spot to park in.

Came on a Saturday and people traffic want too bad. They had a good line flowing through. Seating is limited so you risk not being able to sit down. Now since Covid is lingering, I'd like to say I didn't see them cleaning their tables so there is some risk there. I always carry wet ones and I've always done it, do it till this day. So we cleaned it down. 

Hubby had the cheesesteak hoagie and I had the regular one with provolone cheese. Has lots of onions but it was pretty cheesy so we liked that. Meat wasn't too bad and they provide pickles and pickled peppers. Delicious! Overall, good bread, good amount of cheese, and meat had flavor. I love salsa so that's all I needed. Lol!

Granted, the place was virtually empty (it was a Monday), which should have caused me to rethink my decision to eat there. On to the meal: the salad with ""grilled"" peaches was a flaccid, bland young-romaine mix, prewashed and shaken straight from the bag no doubt. The peaches were tart slivers, not the succulent grilled halves or quarters I had envisioned. The dressing did taste of tarragon, which was pleasant, but it lacked the requisite tang of a vinaigrette. I ate the pieces of ricotta salata and the peaches, leaving most of the greens. The server took the dish away without comment. My main dish, a burger, was more medium than rare, as I had ordered it, and the beef had a slightly gamy ""off"" flavor. It was accompanied by a little heap of fries that were limp with oil. The brioche bun was a nice touch. I ate about half of the burger and, other than offering to wrap it up for me, the server did not ask if I was satisfied or why I had left so much on the plate.

I decided that it would be unwise to order dessert. 

In closing, the place is not especially alluring in its décor and the service was not attentive. There's an open kitchen and I had expected to feel the charge of culinary creativity emanating from it, but the mood was relatively flat.

As a disclaimer, I've never experienced what it's like as a club, but I have tried...it's just that every time I've tried things have fallen apart. This is a running theme whenever I visit.

The food is overpriced but entirely average. For those calling it a gastropub, I sincerely hope that you broaden your horizons because for the most part it is cut and dry bar food except for the few ""Celtic Cuisine"" dishes. Now, there's nothing wrong with that, except for two things: A) They are overpriced and B) they taste entirely average.

Probably the best part is the beer selection, and its correctly served Guinness is a saving grace, but I invariably seem to look over my bill and realize I've been overcharged, and on one occasion, that I had been served the wrong beer. They try way too hard to be an Irish pub, instead of BEING an Irish pub (as a note, manydiners don't like a bagpiper blasting away right behind him while drinking).

My favorite part of the meal was my salad -- I enjoyed the Chopped Salad with the abundant green olives, garbanzos, pistachios, cheese, and the house-made pepperoni. At first it seemed pretty dry, but the flavors and the oil from the olives made up for it. 

What is going on with the burned pizza crust, though? I ordered the Holmes, which was dotted with black spots on the dough -- all along the edges and on the bottom. Now, I like a good browning of pizza cheese that enhances the flavor of the pizza, but the blackened crust interfered with the flavor, and I noticed that other pizzas served around the restaurant looked just like this, so it wasn't a mistake made with my pizza alone. 

Other thoughts: roasted broccoli was tasty, though salty and a bit overcooked. Cacio de Pepe - peppery and dry. I liked the flavor, but I was scraping the bowl to get at the minimal cheese sauce. It was more like peppery buttered noodles.

I loved the blue cheese served with local honey the best, followed by the goat cheese with sweet mashed figs, and the Country Pâte with its own sauce to compliment. If you like fancy meats and cheese, it's a must order. We also got the marinated olives ($5) topped with Thyme and, strangely, orange shavings, which I wasn't a fan of at all. 

For our main course we ordered the Pan Roasted Scallops ($24) and the Salmon Nicoise ($18). The salmon was a bit too overcooked for my taste and cooked inconsistently, although even with these nit picks it was still very favorable. The scallops was the better of the two dishes. Yes you only get three half dollar size pan seared scallops, but it's surprisingly filling with the savory pine nuts and scallop jus (a thin gravy or sauce made from meat juices). These were perfectly prepared, and the rich and flavorful jus really added to the dish. We paired both dishes with the Pinot Grigio, Al Verdi, Molise, Italy 2014.

When I made a reservation I initially had planned to go to crafty crab but guess got confused and made reservations for here instead and ended up at the Crack Crab instead- huge mix up on my part. Well we arrived and the place was small, it seemed more like a place you'd pick up food or do take out versus dine in. We had the reservation, but it was silly cause the place was empty and I guess you really didn't need one. We were seated quickly and got drinks. 

We started with some corn nuggets- which was a special for the day- for a $1.99 you got about 12 of these fried balls that had corn inside of them. I liked them but my boo didn't care for them. We also had a free appetizer with Yelp check in which was sweet! We got the spring rolls- they were okay. 

When looking at the menu they had a nice variety of things but I guess in comparison to the crafty crabs menu that I had looked at and thought I was at- the menu was lacking and I wasn't sure what I'd order. I ended up getting the fried fish which the waiter told me was cod. 

This seafood place has Asian fusion also and sells hibachi which is kinda interesting. The fried fish came out and it was inside a little boat- it was a cute presentation. The fried fish was inexpensive and actually tasted pretty good. I was happy with my selection. The only thing I would complain about is the fact that the fish came by itself, not with cole slaw or fries which was lame. I felt like it was missing something. 

For dessert we ended up getting the Oreo cheesecake- but not too sure it was Oreo cheesecake- tasted more like just a plain Oreo cake.

Firstly, the pizza is really good...not amazing, but solid. I ordered a slice of the pizza pie (top crust) with pepperoni, sausage, sauce and cheese inside. It was hot, the cheese was gooey, and 1 slice filled me up for hours. 

HOWEVER, the service here was lacking. The man behind the counter scowled at me for not knowing what I wanted to order (there was NO ONE behind me in line). That was off-putting, but I was hungry so I let it slide. Once I ordered, people came from outta nowhere and made the once comfortable standing space quite cramped and awkward. They have a nice sized dining area, but the area where you order needs a complete overhaul. (Side note: the average American woman is a size 8-10, not a 2-4...especially not if they're eating pizza on a regular. Make room!!)

Lastly, I paid with a card. I was told it was a $5 min, so I ""needed"" to add a drink, to which I obliged. Then he just stares at me, as if (by telepathy, I suppose) I know what fountain drinks they have (fountain was not labeled!)...He makes the drink then hands my card to the guy next to him and he says to me ""move over""...smh...I paid and got the heck out of there before I changed my entire mind or gave them a piece of said mind.

As far as the food goes the tacos are delicious, you first pick your shell (corn, flour, or hard) and then beef, pork, steak, chicken, they even have a veggie option for those non meat eaters. I tend to think that three tacos are the perfect size for a meal, however I wouldn't fault you for getting more and trying one of each! Taco Circus reminds me of Mission Taco only much cheaper!

Much more quantity over quality, but compared to the other AYCE sushi in town (i.e. Sushi Train), this location may have just slightly better quality sushi. But don't expect much and especially don't expect too much from the freshness. Most of their rolls are cooked anyway, so if you're not huge on raw fish, then this may be a good choice for you. 

My friend and I tried a good amount of stuff on their AYCE menu, but there wasn't anything that stood out to me - nothing was impressionable enough for me to remember it. I did think it was interesting that they had options for dim sum (just ha kao and siu mai - both weren't good, so I'm going to just save you the trouble from trying it especially since it takes like 30 minutes for them to bring it out). Their ""sushi pizza"" is really weird. It's super fried and oily. Wouldn't recommend getting that one. Their hand rolls are good! And so were the tempura. 

The waitresses aren't the most well trained... sometimes they forgot orders or brought out the wrong ones. It got confusing and tiring having to wait 20 minutes for two pieces of sushi. I wouldn't have minded if it was super busy but my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant for lunch.

I ordered 2 tacos: the Korean BBQ and the Taco Royale with a side of sweet potato fries. Loooove the sweet potato fries, absolutely hated the jalapeno ranch that came with it. It was honestly really gross and I was just not a fan. It had a strange aftertaste and was really bitter on the tongue. I ended up just dipping my fries with ketchup instead. The Korean BBQ taco did not taste like Korean BBQ at all - but it was still good. It just wasn't authentic in either the taco or the bbq sense. The Taco Royale reminded me of a fancy & fresher Crunchwrap Supreme. The sweet potato fries were really good but I also was wondering why a Mexican restaurant was serving sweet potato fries...

I love seafood, and am a little picky, especially when the price starts moving up the scale. Being  a damn good cook myself, I am probably harder to please than a lot of people.

We walked in the door... and there was no hostess, maitre d', headwaiter, etc... or anyone to greet us or seat us. After a minute or so, a waitress showed up and explained they don't have a hostess on the weekdays. She seemed a little grumpy, but maybe that was just my perception. 

She seated us... and gave us the full alcohol spiel. I explained that my girlfriend is allergic to alcohol, and I don't drink when I am driving. We ordered water... as that really is my preference. She delivered the water... and we ordered some Conch Fritters. We also  ordered the main courses... I chose blackened shrimp with a Caesar salad... GF got the Fish and Chips.

Conch Fritters were meh.. crispy outside, but mush inside, and the conch was tough.

Blackened shrimp were the 60 to a pound size, and I got two skewers.. maybe 20 to 24 shrimp. SMALL shrimp! Blackening was mostly cayenne, and it did not have the complexity I expect from good blackening spices. Cajuns blacken with a ton of butter... that did not happen either (maybe trying to be healthy?), and it does add a lot of flavor. Salad was ok... but the dressing was out of a bottle.

Girlfriend said her Fish and Chips was good, but she only ate the fish, only had three of the fries (and she loves fries)... and barely touched the Slaw (and yes, she loves good slaw). So what does that say?

And the waitress never did seem very happy to be there either! 

I usually tip well... and I think I only did about 18% here.. instead of my usual 20-25%... because if it is that hard to be there, someone needs to look for a different job. 

We did not do dessert...  

Maybe my expectations are too high? If I want Red Lobster, I will go there... and that is what I feel I got (and no, I don't consider Red Lobster to be good seafood!)  lol!

When I stopped in on a muggy May night last week, I sampled their moscow mule, front porch mint, and the (vegan) coconut chocolate fudge.  When it came to decision making time, I decided on the salted crack caramel and madagascar vanilla.  With chunks of salted chocolate cracker candy and vanilla bean specks had my taste buds in heaven for a few minutes!

The flavors made it the perfect margarita for brunch. My only complaint is that it took over 20 minutes for me to receive the marg after ordering it.

So I took the bus all the way.
Cause I'm craving guac
and I just can't stop.
I've been thinking 'bout it all day
Tacos sitting in my bell-ay.
Batter fry those fish
Put them on my dish, baby

My hands
Got sauce dripping down, but I'm not stopping.
No chance
That I won't pick back up that bite I'm dropping
I know
Yeah, I already know I want another
I got big plans for tacos
in my hands, baby.

Good tacos (fish is totally worth the extra 50 cents), great guac (steep price made more clear by the HUGE portion size), and their fountain soda is fancy AF. Garces does a bang-up job, typically.

Friend got a salad topped with ""shrimp"" (extra $5) and got 5 individual shrimp. A dollar per shrimp feels a little silly, they were very petite. We ordered some sides, too, which weirdly came about 7 minutes before our taco entrees with our guac - would prefer them to come simultaneously, as they were hot and cooled down a bit by taco time.",2017-11-09 15:13:36

Perfectly named for an exceptional dining experience in Music City.  Beautiful decor, friendly and very knowledgable staff. The service was top notch. Attentive but not bothersome.

I hate cauliflower but if my momma had served it grilled and tossed in buffalo sauce I would have had it twice a day! Add to that some exquisitely seasoned Brussel sprouts and you have two appetizers you can feel good about eating. The beef cheeks were awesome, the sauce/gravy was rich but not salty. The steak was perfectly cooked but would have preferred it to be served whole as opposed to sliced. That being said, the steak was delightful.

The meal was topped off with a hot pecan pie served with coffee ice cream. It was so well balanced and exceptionally prepared that it should be a crime to serve it any other way!

The bad of the night was the food and that is where the low rating comes from.  For a app we got some Beef Bulgolgi tacos.  The hoisin sauce was so sweet that it made them very hard to eat.  For outer entrees my wife had yamada roll and I had the seafood ceviche.  These like the app were both only one note with the sushi trading only like the sauce(to me, my wife liked it) and the ceviche tasting only of cilantro.

Other things fell short: my chicken on the bone was tender and nicely spiced but a little cloyingly sweet and came with no sides, which I thought was odd. Just four sticky sweet chicken legs all in a row. My husband's steak was almost flavorless and a little overcooked - just not a good piece of meat. 

Other aspects of the evening were just plain bad. The waiter was, well, stoned. A nice guy and cute as a button, but he couldn't keep track of what was going one...like whether we had ordered yet, or whether we had just arrived or were waiting for the check. 

A major drawback of SoBou is that it feels like a hotel restaurant so the crowd is what you get at a hotel sometimes. We had both bachelor and bachelorette parties with all of the accompanying yelling, cursing, and craziness. Posh New Orleanians were seated next to suburban moms from outside Cleveland next to twenty-two year-olds enjoying a pit stop from Bourbon Street. It all added up to a weird atmosphere.

I need to give a shoutout to the sommelier Patrick who did his best - offered comped, lovely  appetizer and wine pairing plus lots of personal attention - to make up for our server's inadequacy.

Two of my best friends came into town to visit me. One of them is fairly allergic to a lot of things. I figured a place like the Libertine would be accommodating. In fact, we called  before we headed over to see if it would be ok.

It was a Sunday night. Not a lot of people were around when we got there. My friends and I sat down and chatted for a bit. Maybe we should've figured out what we wanted... but when the waiter showed up, we weren't ready to even order drinks and he was visibly upset. We ordered a few beers (I didn't know their Urban Chestnut wasn't on tap!) and then ordered food. Due to my friend's allergies, we had a lot of questions and the waiter got visibly upset again. My friend was uncomfortable enough to stop asking questions. 

When the food came out, we were impressed by the generous portion sizes for the sides and appetizers. The corn was good. The mussels were good. My food was amazing. My boyfriend's pasta and pork belly was fantastic. One person's burger was over cooked but when we flagged down a server and sent it back, the server was accommodating and friendly.

Unfortunately my  husband took a mystery shop at this place, so I went with him.

A Baja Frat House of sorts- neon bright yellow and blue everything with ""eat me"" on the tops of the tables and on the walls. I wish someone would have yelled ""food fight""...

I ordered the Fajita Plate. It came with 2 sides. I chose the Borracho Beans (pinto beans with beer and bacon) and the Cilantro-Lime Rice. The sides were big but bland. All I could smell was warm beer (from the beans), so I had to put them in a relocation program. The rice was devoid of Cilantro or lime. The Fajita mix portion was very small. The tortilla's were dry. 

Even the Diet Coke was lacking carbonation. 

Missing the customary chips and salsa provided at most Mexican restaurants,  I went back and ordered some. Mistake! They season the chips with something, but all I could think of was Lawry's Season salt. The salsa was flavorless. I was asked if I wanted the salsa hot or cold. Who eats hot salsa?

Mom gave us an anniversary present and it was also her birthday (we argued over who was paying the bill). Yummy experience, complete with fantastic scenery!

My husband thoroughly enjoyed his 3-onion soup appetizer, complete with crusty bread and white, leek and red onions. Tasty. He called it one of the best onion soups he's ever had. Tall compliment! Acacia provided unlimited fresh organic bread-unusual and tasty. I believe the bread choices change from day to day.

Mom & I split Thai chicken dumplings for our appetizer. They were mild, but the medium spicy sauce was off limits for my mother's tolerance levels. Wasabi was served on the side, but it sat ignored by our low-spice tolerance mouths. Excellent dumplings.

I ordered halibut, which was really tasty; I loved the carmelized or darkened effect. My husband enjoyed cioppino--a unique spicy, smoky flavor. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of scallops, crab claws, shrimp, salmon and mussels (& more) that it contained! It was a hearty serving--and nothing was left! That was clear testimony from a happy diner.

We were treated to a dessert for the special occasion, to our delight. Unique and delicious strawberry-lime crumble with vanilla ice cream. It sounded questionable to me--however, I was game for some adventure and it was really good. Raspberry sauce was dribbled on it, and it also contained fresh berries on the side and cooked ones in the crumble.

Lovely ambiance and view from our table. It was a bit noisy for an upscale restaurant-I think that part of the ambiance was intended when it was designed.

Menu is large with some unique items and of course the bakery is also on display. Service was slow , mostly the food from the kitchen. I mean really slow. I ordered two eggs with the ham steak. The ham was a thin piece of over cooked dried out ham. Sure it was a whole 'steak' but was too thin and could hardly cut with a knife. Egg whites were good as well as potatoes. We also ordered once of the Cuban type sandwiches with egg pork salami and ham. Was a bit too soggy.   We won't be going back as there are so many better breakfast options around the area. Bathrooms were unavailable at 9 am as they picked that time to clean them. Great planning. 

I also find it odd that half of  LCD screens around the dining area show advertisements for Pasco County lawyers and other services. Find it such a cheap thing for the owners to do, but I guess they have to make up some revenue for how long this place took to open.

Gallito Taqueria serves Duck Carnitas, Carne Asada, Pork Belly Pastor, Chicken Tinga, and Barbacoa Butternut Tacos for $4 per piece, street corn, mango with chili. 

To drink, Gallito Taqueria serves Modelo Especial Lager, Victoria Lager, Pacifico Pilsner, and Corona Familiar Amber for $6, Sangria, Pavo Real Red Blend Wine, Pavo Real White Blend Wine for $8, and Jarritos flavored sodas for $3. 

You have to stand in a long line for 45 min to place your order and then stand in another line waiting for another 10 minutes to get your order.  We ended up ordering 3 tacos which included the Duck Carnitas, Pork Belly Pastor, and Chicken Tinga. The tacos were so small, they're about half the size of regular tacos and about half the size of my phone. The Duck carnitas was my favorite followed by the Pork Belly. The tacos sadly didn't come well marinated and to my shock there was absolutely no salsa or hot sauce available, which really left these tacos quite dry and lacking flavor. Sadly, we left still hungry. If the tacos were better we might have ordered more, but with how long it took to get tacos, we didn't bother. When we placed our order, the server should have warned us that the tacos are tiny and we should order more. 

I judge all Mexican restaurants based on their house made chips and salsa and house made hot sauce but sadly Gallito Taqueria didn't even have store bought chips and salsa or store bought hot sauce so for that reason, they're gonna get a low score in my book. Add the wait time to get food, poor flavor of the tacos, no table service, no hot sauce, visiting this Mexican Restaurant was just not an enjoyable experience at all. We didn't even have a table to sit at. We had to sit on the steps which wasn't the most comfortable.

It's a shame that a real full service sit down Mexican Restaurant with an extensive menu and mariachi band, Hablo Taco, had to be bull-dozed to make way for this concept but it did bring back new life to the area. If you want a real sit down full service Mexican Restaurant in Downtown Tampa with decent sized tacos, house made hot sauces, house made delicious salsa and chips, I highly recommend going to Urban Cantina or Taco Bus instead of this place.  

Management, please stock some hot sauces, chips and salsa, offer table side service, offer larger tacos, and add better marination and more toppings to your tacos! If I do come back and see some improvements I am open to raising their score.",2018-12-01 14:23:04

I sat at the bar and ordered the 35 cent medium buffalo wings and Mac 'n' Cheese Wedges. The wings were decent and the wedges were definitely cheesy (a good thing).  I was more impressed with their variety of craft beers on tap and enjoyed a Summit Dunkle Weizen. All in all, a decent spot to grab some grub.",2012-06-07 02:06:35

Though eating fries is almost always a positive experience, the fries here are particularly good.  They are seasoned the right amount, are a perfect thickness without losing crispness on the exterior, and the dipping sauces available are great.  I recommend getting the garlic and Parmesan added to your fries, though beware that it's raw garlic if you expected something else.  My favorite dipping sauces are the curry ketchup and the chipotle aioli.  As to beer, there are not many selections on tap but there are a ton of bottles available.  I would give this place four stars if it increased the draft beer selection.

As to ambience, I recommend you get a seat on the second floor's outside deck area.  It's the best location in Santa Barbara to just look out onto State Street and enjoy the relatively calm bustle of downtown Santa Barbara.  

Service is also what makes this a three star establishment rather than four.  Though the servers are always nice once they come to the table, it takes far too long for that to occur especially in the second story outside seating area.",2019-02-23 17:29:37

I value food the most, so in the end I give it four stars, but it's certainly not far off from a five star experience.

I ordered the arugula salad with burrata and tomatoes.  The salad was a bit heavy on the arugula, but the burrata and tomatoes mixed well with it. I recommend putting arugula, burrata, and tomatoes on the free toasted bread they give you to maximize the deliciousness. The gnocchi with ricotta was great, though it came as three or four large gnocchi rather than many smaller individual gnocchi.  Out of all the items we ordered, I'd say that we could have skipped the lamb chops based on the price to taste combo.  That dish was fine, but it didn't have the same pop as the pasta dishes.

Overall, Via Maestra provides a romantic Italian experience tucked away on upper State Street. There are few restaurants that provide a cozier vibe than this, and the servers are kind and helpful.  I'd highly recommend going, and pro tip that they don't take reservations for parties under six people but they allow you to put your name on the waiting list by phone.",2019-02-17 19:58:41

We started with the smoked salmon flatbread which was a disappointment. We had about 1 salmon piece on the whole flat bread and it was basically a salad. The dressing they used was nice and light but I cannot recommend this dish.

Moving on to the entree round is where the restaurant received it's stars. My husband got the Australian Sea bass special. This was amazing the Sea bass was crisp yet still light and flaky. The risotto was perfectly creamy and cooked to perfection.

I ordered the black truffle potato encrusted tuna which was served with the freshest and crispest free beans I have ever had!

When you first walk in, you don't expect much but when you get to the back of the restaurant, you see the beautiful intercoastal water way. It was so pretty! We decided to sit outside on that beautiful day and take in the water views.  Before my food comes, I go to wash my hands. The women's bathroom fits one person. It's small and dated but very clean and there was some interesting artwork on the wall.

We had a lot of delicious food options to choose from at Maggie Mae's but I decided on the signature Corned Beef Hash because it's house-made hash with slow roasted corned beef. It is topped with two eggs of your choice. I ordered my eggs over easy and an English muffin. I really hate the canned stuff so whenever I go to a diner, I look for corned beef hash with REAL cooked corned beef. This was the real deal. It was perfectly made and really delicious!  My friend had the Almost Famous Chicken Salad Sandwich served with wheat bread. It comes with lettuce and tomato and chips on the side. You can also make it a wrap if you want to.

The rush died down to the point that the restaurant was nearly empty, and we continued to wait some more. A few feet away from us, three servers stood around chatting. We joked about this and even waved our menus around. At this point, we were the only party sitting in the row of booths, and those menus are big enough to direct air traffic, so it would be pretty hard to not see us.

Wife had halibut and I went with the filet.  Portion size was just right.  My filet was spot on temp and perfectly seasoned.  My wife loved her halibut as well as the sides on the plate.

Desert - we went with a peanut butter something (can't remember name).  It was actually a trifecta of desert - 3 different deserts on one plate.  Delish.

The portion sizes were generous, the food was exceedingly delicious, delivery was fast, and it was a great value for the money spent.

Tuna Pumpkin (Lobster Salad wrapped in Tuna, with Mosago): 4 out of 5
This appetizer, served chilled, consisted of large chunk lobster salad rolled inside a raw tuna sashimi ""pumpkin,"" topped with mosago. There were two ""pumpkins"" per order, each slightly larger than a large egg. The lobster salad was cold, fresh, succulent, and moist. The Bluefin tuna on the outside was equally fresh and delicious.

Seaweed Salad: 5 out of 5
The seaweed salad had a nice balance of crisp, fresh-tasting seaweed, light dressing, a sparing amount of white sesame seeds; and sat atop a bed of skinless cucumber spears. It arrived very cold (even in 80 degree weather) and was refreshing to eat. In terms of portion-size, it filled the better part of your standard small square plastic salad container. Fresh, cold, sweet, tangy...It doesn't get any better than this!

Volcano Roll (Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Avocado and Tempura Crunch, served with ""chef's special sauce"" [spicy mayo, unagi sauce, and some other unidentifiable, yet tasty, sauce], wrapped in Soy Bean Wrapper): 5 out of 5
The sweetness from the soy bean wrapper, white rice, and unagi sauce imparted a subtle contrast to the salty soy sauce-dipped spicy tuna and creamy avocado, with a satisfying crunch of the tempura flakes and the kick of pepper from the spicy mayo. I should add that this is an ""over-sized"" roll, so it is twice the size of your average spicy tuna roll.

We couldn't have asked for a better takeout experience. I look forward to ordering from Sumo again soon!",2012-07-03 18:03:01

And there is little worse than The Getaway.

The tiki bar ideal rests somewhere between the exotic and the antiquated--yes, you want something with a South Seas-ish flavor, but you also appreciate it with a sense of ironic distance--you're acutely aware that you're not in Fiji or Honolulu or wherever, and take a sort of pleasure in that fact. So you expect it to be a bit campy, to serve antiquated drinks, to have a selection of red-faced, lovable drunks in beflowered shirts. You expect some sort of dusty, lacquered swordfish over the bar, sufficient thatch to equip a village of kraals, bamboo siding, a few carved grotesques. If your standards are ludicrously high, you expect the bar to be carved of koa wood, though this fact has long been forgotten and the bar itself defaced by countless rum-fueled scratchings and scrawlings.

Yet The Getaway is relentlessly modern; everything is landscaped into oblivion, to the point that the palms are visibly propped up with pylons and the furniture seems like it's off the rack at IKEA, and the spotless bar is managed by people wearing matching t-shirts and populated by a mixture of people who clearly dressed for a night out. The menus are printed immaculately on meticulously laminated cards.

No, I can't fault the place for being clean, though I can evince some existential angst at the fact that this is what passes for a tiki bar in this day and age: a shiny plastic recreation of something better somewhere else. So I'll fault The Getaway for a lot of other things instead. The parking situation is abominable (right off the Gandy Bridge, and if you don't get P.I.T.-maneuvered by one of the cars barreling down the road as you try to turn in, you're likely to be squashed by a jacked-up beach buggy whilst trying to get from your car to the bar area), the lighting has a vile sort of clinical affectation that makes you feel like you're drinking in a hospital cafeteria, the crowd is cloying and treacly, the chairs (which are clearly not meant to be beach chairs) inexorably draw you downward to a sandy grave.

Two additional offenses bear mentioning though: the drinks and the music. The drinks are fine (if spendy) so long as you stick to simple things. The rickey I had was fine, (and it had damn well better be, since it's just liquor, lime juice, and soda), but my companions, hell-bent on having the Authentic Tiki Bar Experience (tm) if it killed them, ordered some of the fruitier and blended drinks. The fruity rum drink tasted like banana-flavored antifreeze, which was perhaps not all that far from other rum drinks I've had, but my other companion, against our better judgment and the very laws of decency themselves, ordered something called a ""Cabbage Key Creeper"" (the very name itself conjuring poor decisions--do you really want to be the sort of person who strides manfully up to the bar and orders, in a brash tone, a ""Creeper?""), which proved to be composed primarily of Kahlua and stagnant drippings from the water bowl of Cerberus, Guardian of Hades. It was one of those drinks that you sip and then immediately experience an involuntary bodily tremor, as if the lower functions of your brain were desperately attempting to forcibly expunge whatever you've been foolish enough to ingest. The Creeper sat untouched upon the (slowly sinking) table as our doomed companion went back to order a beer.

Also, the music, if ""music"" is indeed the right term for the cacophonous assault of seemingly randomly-distributed thuds and screeches that had been selected as the entertainment for the night in question. Yeah, you might have expected ukelele music or slack-key guitar or calypso or steel-drum music or some sort of Brazilian tango thing in a pinch, but no. This was basically what sounded like bad karaoke music for people with a preternaturally high tolerance for electronica, though not to a sufficient extent to break out the glow sticks and body glitter. it was too loud to carry on a conversation (even at an optimal distance from the stage), so our merry band simply gazed out over the water and wished (in vain) that we were listening to the tortured wailings of the damned or something instead.

The Getaway receives one extra star for its waterfront location and the patronage of local food trucks. Besides that, I very much felt, by the end, that it was a place that I had to get away from.",2014-03-23 22:39:37

There are only a few options. Yet we stood in line for a long time while customers figured out how to deal with the menu and how to pay for their meal. Something needs to be adjusted.

I also have experience with restaurants in general and for a place that's been open for a little more than a year, Joella's seems tired and worn. For the hour we were there, I didn't see anyone clean a table. No sparkle to the place.

We ordered chicken, just like everyone else. After 15 minutes or so, the cashier came to us apologetically and said the kitchen hadn't made up enough of the quarter-whites and it was going to take another 15 minutes or so to get our order out. This with maybe 10 other customers in the house (not counting take-outs). We waited. He did graciously offer us complimentary desserts.

Where I wish they'd step their game up is in the service area.

I must have come on a really off night because it wasn't good in any sense of the word. For starters, the host took about 2 minutes looking at the seating chart to figure out where to seat us, mind you, the restaurant was pretty empty, I think there were maybe 5 tables of people and that was it. She finally looked up and said ""I'm just trying to figure out which server is going to be the fastest."" Hmmmmm....that doesn't instill confidence that we are about to get good service. We sit down and it takes about 10 minutes for our server to come to our table. Not a great start but I've worked restaurants before, I'm pretty forgiving so we ordered our waters and food while he was still around, I didn't want to wait another 10 minutes before he came back to order food. Our friends that we were with mentioned that the menu had changed and that the prices were higher than they remember. About 10 minutes later some biscuits were brought to the table, but only 3...and there were 4 of us...so another server brought another one around about 5 minutes later. The biscuit was good, I will give them credit that it was a really tasty biscuit. The food came out and I had ordered a chicken sandwich ($16) and it was so overly fried and tough it was really hard to eat. Also, it was just chicken, lettuce, tomato and I think aioli, no cheese, nothing to stick it all together, to give it any flavor. It definitely wasn't worth $16 and it was one of the least expensive menu items. The mac and cheese side was okay, I don't get why people think so highly of it, it was just soupy cheese and some noodles. It took about 20 more minutes before we got the checks and then another 10 to get our cards back. The night took about 2 hours, which was fine because we were hanging out with friends and it gave us plenty of time to talk. Even though the service was slow, the server and the hostess were very friendly.",2017-04-28 13:53:47

I don't find myself hating beer much, and I can't remember the last time I couldn't drink a beer that was placed in front of me. But I took one drink and that was the end. 

After the waitress cleared our plates, she asked why I didn't drink my beer. I told her I didn't like it. She told me I should have said something, but in reality she hadn't been back to our table since bringing our food. She did however bring me a different beer, which was delicious. But she forgot to bring the second round for one of my companions, which she didn't notice until she returned 20 minutes later to see if I liked my beer.

We sat at the bar and ordered and IPA and a stout. Both were HOB brews and good. As we enjoyed those we read all of the signs. A small sign way up to the right of the many said Thursdays after 7 pm 2 for 1 on a few choices and we happened to order the blueberry beer so we received 2 for 1. 

Now, as we were enjoying our 2nd one the new shift came in for the evening. We also looked around and we noticed the crowd. This place was full of 20 and 30 something HIPSTER people who were growing louder and louder as time went on. Staff turned into 2 20 something female bartenders who had no idea how to actually 'wait' on customers. People sat with empty beer glasses needing refills for long amounts of time and neither 'bartender' asked what they wanted next. They would rather gossip at each other at the end of the bar. When your sole purpose at work is to wait on people... do it. These two customers will not be back. The 'bartenders' sealed the deal. 

They offer t-shirts which were pretty neat. We liked several of their designs. 

They have dart board and a life size Jenga game which is positioned in the middle of the bar. When it topples over watch out because the bricks go flying and it is LOUD!!! Another disappointment. Put rubber pads down so it doesn't sound like the place is getting bombed. Or better yet, move it outside. 

The layout of this place is interesting. I am not sure if they bought this place this way or they added walls but it has zero flow and is not aesthetically pleasing at all. 

There is a nice patio out front which is covered so you can enjoy it on those super sunny hot days or those rainy days. There is also a patio out back which is you more low key typical garden patio. 

Bathroom was clean but had a weird chalk message on the wall. The garbage can was located in the other corner of the bathroom which made it impossible to open the door with a napkin and then get it into the garbage can. Hopefully they put an open garbage can by the door so people aren't throwing paper towels on the floor. 

All in all we enjoyed the beer which is what we set out to do today. But the staff and ambience were a huge let down. Prices were fair. They do offer 5 and 12 oz pours along with 16 oz. 

We won't be back. What is with HOB? This is our second one (Palm Harbor was the first) and they are both not enjoyable. Many people would probably disagree as lots of people were having fun. Could be a really neat place if they made the right changes.",2017-06-02 14:02:03

There was no flavor, I was expecting some berry flavor mixed with spiciness, but it just tasted like a glazed donut. The only time I got berry flavor was the bite with the whole blackberry garnish. The bottom was greasy. The consistency of the dough was thick and heavy. I was not going back, but my husband brought home a donut for me recently so gave it another shot. A bourbon something or other, right up my alley. Same problems as the first donut. Greasy bottom, tough, thick dough, no flavor beyond sugar sweetness. But this one did have one good bite that contained the bourbon flavor. But it was just one bite, not enough to justify the cost or eating the rest of the donut to find it.

What I do appreciate about Bamboozle is the variety on the menu.

I also like the restaurant's proximity to Curtis Hixon Park.

What I didn't appreciate is that it took a long time to get food and boba drinks. I also didn't that I the food was as tasty as an authentic Vietnamese restaurant. The broth in the pho lacked flavor. I liked that I was able to get a beef lemongrass banh mi, but the French bread wasn't up to par. The boba drinks weren't as good as what you can get elsewhere either.

Kidding. 

It took me 11 months to write this as my 400th review. A special number for a special restaurant. HubbyStanks and I do steak for the Anniversary wherever we are and since we were in town he took me to Bern's. 

For dinner I ordered THE best steak, chateaubriand medium rare. It melted in my mouth. No one talks about the carrot side, which doesn't look like much, but I love it as much as the onion rings. The macadamia nut dressing for the salad is a dream come true. Macadamia nuts are my favorite nut. the French onion soup is delish. You get a whole lot when you order your steak. The experience, including impeccable service from staff who have been with Bern's a long time, isn well worth your dollar.

You must tour Bern's at least once to really appreciate its fame. The kitchen is a machine and the wine cellar is truly iconic. 

The dessert room is a must. Again, macadamia! Macadamia ice cream is always on the menu and is fine alone, but there are desserts featuring macadamia and the ice cream. Coffee is a must with dessert...if you're not drinking wine of course. The regular coffee is made in the same coffee machine that's been around since Bern's inception and makes it delicious. 

A wonderful place to spend a special evening.",2017-10-06 00:52:28

I've had the donut grilled cheese at events and I thought it was pretty good. Unfortunately the concept of this restaurant is better than the taste. I actually ate at a place in downtown Denver last summer with the exact same concept, but it tasted a lot better. 

I loooove grilled cheese and I make a mean grilled cheese (and many grilled sandwiches) so I really expect a grilled cheese restaurant to do a better job. 

The sandwiches aren't cheesy enough. The bread isn't as crisp and buttery enough. The tomato soup isn't tasty enough. The salad is basic.

I give this 3 stars because if it were closer to me I'd still come for a convenient lunch. However, I'm never going to drive all the way out to Saint Pete and pass all the wonderful restaurants to the Tyrone neighborhood just to get a mediocre grilled cheese sandwich that didn't blow me away.",2017-06-15 22:48:14

It's a lot smaller than the chains, but the service and meats are up to par. The salad bar spread is smaller, but the quality of the items on the bar are really good and kept clean and presentable. My favorite bar items was the paella, hearts of palm, black beans and the cabbage salad.

I think it's a great alternative to the chain in town and I would recommend it to anyone wondering if they should go. The food and the service is fantastic. Some meats I liked better than others. Surprisingly, I liked the chicken and chicken hearts the most! The Parmesan crusted steak was just okay. The other beef options were tasty. The lamb was melt in your mouth delish.

What I think should be changed:

1. Add more salads & veggies to the salad bar. Way too many mayo based salads as opposed to actual veggies.

2. More lamb choices. Was there for almost 2 hours before a piece of lamb was offered. Would be nice to see lamb chops and a leg of lamb.

3. More than one cheese on the salad bar please.

4. Tea shouldn't be charged refills.

5. The price point should be more like $23 for what you get. 

6. The 12% service charge is unnecessary and will probably get people not to leave a better tip since you assume people won't leave one. My family usually leaves an average of 20%...more for great service and less (15%) for bad service. So the service charge addition is insulting when the party isn't 8 people. I'd be curious to know if this was only imposed on my family.

7. Pass the chicken hearts more often. :)",2015-07-27 14:33:18

I've only had lunch here and I say it's a good bang for your buck. If you happen to be in the area it's AYCE good Indian fare. We've even taken our children here and they liked the selection too. The saag paneer is very good here, curry goat is always a meat choice and the naan is hot and tasty.

It's attached to a gas station, so that can be off putting to many. If you're like me, you realize that you find some of the tastiest foods in locally owned hole in the walls...even local convenience stores. Soooo this convenience store decided the best use of square footage would be to place a small restaurant inside! There are about 4 tables and room for the buffet. There's even a sink to wash your hands in the corner (they probably had no choice, but in glad it's there).

The biggest negative is parking. Since this gas station shares the Westshore mall parking area and kennedy is a busy street, parking can be a pain.

Since I don't find myself in the area during the work week as often as I used to I don't see myself going out of my way to eat here, but if the same restaurant were close to my home I would frequent it. If I am in the area the choice to eat here would really be based on if I can find a parking spot or not since there are many food choices in the area.",2014-09-22 12:36:36

Here you can get an agua de Jamaica that isn't so tart that you can't drink it. It's a bit sweet for me (by nature they all are). 

The staff is extremely friendly. The joint itself is tiny since you dine in the front room of an old house. The seats fill up fast if you're dining in. 

I have only one complaint. It's not this way all the time. I guess I should expect this to occur every so often by now. This has happened at every taco place I've ever frequented so I won't dock a star for it: I go to squeeze a cut lime onto my taco and it's dry as hell.",2015-04-22 01:50:43

Although we didn't have a reservation, we were told that a table would open up in 20 minutes, to which we gladly put our name down and patiently waited for our seats. Twenty minutes later, an outdoor table opened up and we were given the option to sit there. Since it began raining and there were no parasols, we agreed to sitting there as long as we could move to the next available indoor seats once they opened up. We were even willing to take seats at the bar, if those were going to be available sooner. 

After sitting outside holding our umbrellas, it took at least 15 minutes for our server to give us menus and the server never came back to take our drink order. This was 1.5hrs after we initially put our name down. Meanwhile, a table of 4 which came in after us and sat at the other outdoor table was already receiving their entrees. At that point, I walked into the restaurant to ask about our MIA server and saw two open seats at the bar, which we ended up moving to (these seats had been vacant, but no one had come out to let us know as promised). While we were sitting there, the bartender never made eye contact with us and left us with dirty glasses and graying guacamole stains from the previous customers. After a while, I politely asked the bartender to remove the dirty glasses and stains, but the bartender acted as if we were bothering her. 

Having worked as a server in busy, high volume restaurants for 3 years during college, I'm pretty understanding of delays if I can see good effort (good communication, hustling, a good attitude under pressure), but this was not the case. I don't mind waiting, but we were very hungry and I would have liked to know if we'd have to wait 2 hours so we could decide whether to get food somewhere else. We could have had an entire meal somewhere else during that time, but instead we ended up having to go to another restaurant near their closing time, which was completely unnecessary.

Salmon in lemon sauce is served with creamy sauce with rice and fresh steamed broccoli and sliced carrots. Salmon is on the well done side so it's a little bit overcooked. The lemon is subtle but perfect compliment to the salmon.

Toast is less than a year old, and word has is definitely out on how good it is.  I knew to arrive early, or I'd have a wait in front of me.  We arrived at 9:30 and immediately found 2 seats at the bar.  The regular tables were all full, one with a party of 12 (tables pushed together).  None of the tables outside were occupied because it was still a little chilly outside.

The atmosphere at Toast is bright and cheerful, albeit small.  You're in pretty close quarters with everyone around you, but I'm fine with that.  My only complaint was that it was VERY LOUD.  They've put foam under the chairs and tables, but it didn't seem to be helping much.  Once the large party left, it got considerably better.

I find the prices at Toast to be extremely reasonable for what you get, with entrees ranging from $10-$14, and smaller side items (like toast topped with prosciutto, honey, and ricotta, or an order of ableskivers) going for $5-$8.  

For my entrée, I had the croque madame.  It was huge and delicious, and was served with a light side salad.  My BF had the hangar steak topped with tarragon aioli, served with roasted potatoes and sunny side up eggs.  His meal was also fantastic.

I was really dying to try some of the ableskivers with lemon curd dip, but their portions are huge and there was just no way.

Recently on a cool evening we found ourselves heading out of the Quarter to the Marigny and my friend wanted a hot coffee. I wasn't in a coffee mood, but OK. 

Envie was as usual filled with people worth conversing with....""wow, how many tats do you have? Why are you wearing black socks with boaters and shorts? Man what shade of purple is that in your hair - its exactly what I'm looking for...."" and that's only the folks actually in Envie. The passersby are really what NOLA is all about all the different people melding together in joy. 

Back to the coffee. My friend is busily ordering a basic flavored coffee drink ...When lo and behold my eyes please don't deceive me..... A FULL BAR! Not a coffee bar...we are talking ALCOHOL (which is what I was already consuming and therefore in no dang coffee mood). 

What was that? Did New Orleans just experience an earthquake? Nope, my friend says, that's you trembling in delight (I think my knees may have been knocking loud enough to be heard).... Now would you like to order something? Yes, yes I think I would.

No apologies and we actually had to ask the manager if he knew if we were being seated. And the girl at the front was rude to us. Our waiter was almost overkill on the service.

For starters, they do have a great location, I love the decor, and after looking the menu over, the prices are decent too! But that's all I can come up with for the glaring positives. 
The service was lacking in every way. I did not feel welcomed into the establishment upon entering, and once seated, my waitress showed us just how unenthusiastic to serve us she was. Not cool, at all.

The food was bland and basic. I ordered the chicken and waffles. There wasn't a single bit of crunch or flavor to either my chicken or waffle, such a let down, as I was really banking on the positive reviews from other Yelpers. Maybe other dishes are yummy, but I definitely wouldn't recommend the chicken and waffles meal.",2019-04-15 13:08:19

Things turned the other direction with our sandwiches though.  His was good but nowhere near the flavor development of the other items.  Mine was pretty flavorless.

Some dishes we loved better than others, but rounding up to 5 stars for an overall excellent experience. Favorites were the Korean-fried duck wings, jumbo mayo fried shrimp, and sea bass:

+ Himachi sashimi - the toppings (wasabi vinaigrette & daikon) were a bit overkill and overwhelmed what should have been a delicate sashimi flavor

+ Korean-fried duck wings - as an Asian who is used to eating duck in the Chinese styles, this was a refreshing ""Asian fusion"" version of duck wings. Perfectly fried to airy and crunchy perfection, in the usual Korean fried chicken way.

+ Chilean sea bass (maitake & truffle jus) - by far the hit of the night. Ultra buttery, ""truffle""-y, and fall-apart tender. One of the best fish entrees I've ever had; so simple, yet executed so well

+ Sweet & crispy jumbo shrimp - can't really go wrong with any version of mayo fried shrimps w/ candied walnuts

+ Mango cheesecake - I'm actually not a huge cheesecake fan, but I loved this dish because it achieved such a great subtle fruity note without that overwhelming deli cream cheese flavor that I dislike about cheesecakes. Soft, delicate, and very creamy and delicious.

- Smoky chocolate dome mousse - I was excited by the ""smoky"" flavor and was looking forward to what they would do with it, but it fell pretty flat and was probably my least favorite dish (I couldn't finish it, and I rarely am unable to finish dessert).

None of the food was ready when we arrived, so we just got our drinks and sat down waiting for our orders to be called out.  Several orders came out, but none of the 6 lasagnas.

While waiting, I was able to observe how the lasagna was being made, it was placed into a device that cooked a single piece at a time (pretty cool).  However, I noticed that there was no sauce on the lasagna when it was cooking.  The sauce was added after the lasagna was on the plate.  There was so much sauce on my plate, that the lasagna was drowning in it.  There was supposed to be sides of Sausage, but meat balls were given.  They were decent sized meat balls, but very dry and bland.  There was quite a bit of cheese in mine, which overpowered any other flavor that could have been there.

Despite the challenges, the staff were in good spirits and welcoming.  The crowd was light early in the evening, so I was greeted and helped immediately!

The brewery is the first expansion out of state (Michigan) for this company.  It's located in the former Tow Yard location where Meridian Street angles to become Madison just south of South Street.  Fortunately, they have been told that the road construction should end in about a week, so that will open up access to more parking in the area.  At the time of my writing, there were a few spots along Pennsylvania and a pay lot just north of the business with access off South Street.

Inside, there is a seating area with its own bar to the right as you enter from the elevated entrance on the west end of the building.  There is another bar with seating on the left by the brewing tank area.  That leads back to the second seating area with a view of the kitchen and away from any potential drafts from the entrance.

I chose to order directly from the bar in the first seating area (they do have table service, but I thought I would be more direct.)  I usually order flights of five ounce drinks.  Here, there is no set number in the flight.  All the tap beers were $2 (very good price!) per shorty.  (Note that you can get samples before ordering as well.)  Although they had nine beers to choose from, they had a really nice mix of ales represented.

I started with the Amber Ale (4.7%) which was full of flavor and had a surprisingly darker color than most I've tried.  Full bodied with a very approachable taste.  A great starter!

I moved on to Crescent Fresh IPA (6.2%).  Normally, I don't drink IPA's this early in the flight, but based on what I ordered, this is what my server suggested as next.  The IPA was also a solid, clear choice.  

The third beverage was unlike anything else I've tried locally.  The We've Been Jammed ""Fruit Beer"" (4.5%) is one of those ""dangerous"" drinks because it has so much fruit flavor that I didn't notice the alcohol.  It has a nice balance of sour and sweet with a bit of vanilla.  It was refreshing and delicious and is something I would recommend to anyone who isn't a beer drinker in your party as a starting point.

I finished of with the Tiramisu Coffee Stout (8%).  Though not as sweet as the dessert, it had a deep dark chocolate/coffee taste that was really good.  I can imagine pairing this with dessert.

I was going to a catered event immediately after my visit here, so I didn't try any of their food items.  They do offer a variety of appetizers, some entrees, and pizzas.  Hopefully, I will get to check those out on my next visit.

Great food and knowledgeable service.  The next three times, the food was okay, but I noticed the place was loud and service was pretty good, but not great.  Last night, I went in a group of four and the drop off was so significant that I could no longer give this a high rating.

The waitress was attentive and did a ""good"" job, though there was a mix up between our bills that was partially corrected.  The beer was excellent, as usual.  But the food was just not up to standards we saw when the place opened.  Nobody at the table felt the food was that good.  My pizza had a marinara sauce that might have been plain tomato sauce.  No flavor depth even with multiple toppings.

The worst was my wife's fish and chips.  The fish itself was okay, but the breading/batter was soggy.  She tried it and ended up peeling it off because of the texture.  It was like the fish had been cooked and then either reheated or put in a microwave.  I don't know, but it shouldn't have been soggy.  She could have sent it back, but since everyone was already hungry and had started eating, she put up with peeling it.  A great waitress would have noticed the pile of breading on the plate and have asked.  

And the cole slaw, which most places have as a cool and refreshing or at least creamy with a crunch, was soggy and topped with hot pepper flakes.  My wife doesn't like heat, so she only ate a bite of the cole slaw.  I sampled it and it was so different from what I expect from a cole slaw that I passed on a second bite.  Who wants hot flakes on cole slaw?  Put heat on entrees or wings, but why ruin cole slaw?

I may continue buying their beer, but Speedway now has plenty of other good places to get a good meal.

And if this place is like the one in Greenwood, wait for the ice cream filled donuts in warm weather!

Parking is okay now, but as more shops in the Fishers District (the Yard) open, you may have to park and walk or even use one of the parking garages that should be opening soon.

Inside the shop, you will notice it is long and narrow and it can get a bit crowded in the aisles.  Not only do they have fresh baked donuts/pastries baked in Northern Indiana and driven down daily, but there are lots of local artisan food related items like candies, popcorn, and jellies too.  

While waiting in line, be sure to notice the cool artwork by local (HSE) artist (Ne)Koda Witsken who painted the murals before the grand opening in 2019.  She painted the geometric patterns by the coffee counter and the ""Rise and Shine"" mural of a horse drawn buggy in a rainbow of colors. (She also did the Mudsock Spirit mural in downtown Fishers!)

Some high quality products as in Greenwood, just a little smaller space that makes it a bit harder to get around when busy.

Since it was a Friday night, we arranged to meet there at 5pm in order to snag a table at the bar. These booths are first come, first served so if you don't want to hover around diners who beat you to a booth, get there early! The bar has a piano in the center, with live entertainment starting around 6pm on Fridays. 
Megan was our server. She was attentive, and understood we didn't want to be rushed, which worked out great, although we felt the pressure of the hoverers eyeing our booth from their barstools! 
Be prepared to fork over some cash if you order drinks and apps, desserts- our bill per person came out to about $75/pp. heres's what we tried and how we rated out of 10 point scale:
Steak,mushroom blue cheese flatbread: 10
Garlic chicken flatbread:8 (bring breath mints- whoa)
BBQ chicken full size salad: 7. Chicken was dry
duck salad: 7. Ditto on the ""dry""
desserts: for $2.50 a pop, fun to try- key lime is best bang for calories and flavor, chocolate peanut butter is smooth and delicious. rocky road with marshmallow was good.   All desserts are fun to try @ $2.50, right there in front of you- everyone tried one. Smart, smart marketing. 
All in all, nice night out- three stars because dinner is much more expensive here than the $$ given by Yelpers. If you want to do try this place on the $$ level, go for lunch!",2011-12-03 13:35:07

Nice little romantic, candle lit tables always seem inviting for such a celebration. We arrived around 9:30 on Saturday night and there weren't that many tables sat which was nice for us wanting a nice quiet evening to talk.
On a mission, we already knew what we wanted to order seeing as how we wanted to get a few of the same items we tried during the Yelp event we attended awhile back! Chicken Pad Thai, Salt and Pepper Prawns, Shaking Beef...only this time we decided to try the Tempura green beans. And I really...really wanted a lemon coconut sour again! The drink that carries you away to the beach with one sip! 
Now let me start by saying our waitress was very nice... But one critique would be that she seemed distracted by a table of her personal friends which would have been fine if she gave us equal attention, but she kept visiting them and ignoring us. She brought us our drinks, but didn't light our candle, and when a manager passed by with another busser, lighting candles, however they also failed to light ours. 
We waited for our appetizers watching the room only to watch her return to her friends table and light their candle! So we said screw it, and switched our own candle with one on the table next to us. It was our anniversary after all and we wanted that darn candle light!
Our waitress finally came to tell us there was a ""problem"" in the kitchen, and that they needed to make new, fresh batch of tempura so our appetizer would be a minute more. She then returned to her friends table.
All this aside, our appetizer finally arrived and brought all the happiness and memories that Yelp event brought to the table not to long ago...Wow!!! That sauce, that batter!! They were perfect! Literally perfect. Shortly after that our dinner arrived, and everything was as amazing as we remembered it to be. Leave it to the kitchen staffs abilities to show us again why we love coming here. The food was on point and my drink was just as amazing too! P.F will always get a five star from me because of their tasty food, romantic scenery, and although a bit distracted, very friendly wait staff.",2015-12-07 06:55:26

We are out of towners that love philly and travel here enough to know our way around the city, and we LOVED the old yards location. Our visit summed up in one word: unimpressed. We had planned on spending all afternoon at yards but we got there and were immediately shuffled upstairs when we asked for a table. Which I thought was fine, we got upstairs ordered our beers after waiting for a few minutes. Which waiting people were specifically requesting other beers and the staff said we don't have those upstairs, they are only downstairs. Which was weird to me since we were shuffled upstairs and no even offered to sit upstairs, and advised it was a smaller beer selection. We played darts, their dart board is so worn the darts were bouncing off and back at us (no not user error- we play often), and it was kind of dangerous, I mean darts are sharp. Anyway, went back to the bar and was ignored by 3-4 staff members for like 5 minutes, I mean they stared right at me and didn't offer a "" we'll be with you in a few mins"" just walked by and poured several other beers. I walked away. Eventually I came back to the bar and reluctantly grabbed another beer, again only because I like the beer a lot. We left irritated after we finished our second glass.

First off, they don't make a meat sauce. 
HELLO!!! THIS IS AMERICA!!! LAND OF BACON AND HAMBURGERS!!!
Someone will comment that REAL Italians don't put meat in their sauce. 
I DON'T CARE!!! THIS IS AMERICA, ONLY CHEAP ITALIAN RESTAURANTS DON'T MAKE A MEAT SAUCE!!!
Secondly, the sauce they do make is very bland and un-remarkable.


I rarely have food delivered because I don't have much faith in the process: cold food, takes longer than promised, screwed-up orders, employees possibly tampering with the food, the whole ""TIPPING"" shakedown, etc.

The other night I didn't feel like going out so I called this place and had some spaghetti delivered. 
The woman on the phone asked if I wanted to ""tip the driver"" as I was pre-paying with my card.
I said ""No, I don't know how long it's going to take to receive my food or if it's going to show-up hot or cold. I'm not going to PRE-TIP your employee for a job they haven't even accomplished yet"".

Rizzoli's charges $3.00 for delivery.
The ""DELIVERY CHARGE"" should go directly to the drivers!!! There is NO REASON the restaurant should charge their customers extra money for a delivery if it's going into the owners pocket. The ""DELIVERY CHARGE"" is to pay for their drivers paycheck AND THUS I HAVE ALREADY PAID THE DRIVER FOR DELIVERING ME MY FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I HATE the ""TIPPING"" shake-down!!!

The spaghetti showed-up at the last moment AND IT WAS COLD!!!
Now, mediocre spaghetti that is hot and fresh is at least TOLERABLE!
But, mediocre spaghetti that is cold and going stiff is LOUSY!!!

A simple breakfast or snack while you're working and enjoying the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows around the entire café. 

The ONLY reason this review is not five stars is that there are no outlets in the café at all to power your laptop when you get low. Perhaps this was purposeful so as not to have people hanging around all day, and that's fine, but for people like me who probably stay a max of two hours and just forget to pre-charge their laptop, I was disappointed.

Let's get something out in the open first: I LOVED Horizons and was horrible depressed when it closed. My gut was bursting when I left that place and everything was absolutely amazing and the atmosphere was so, so romantic and cozy. Vedge? Not so much. I mean, it's nice inside but not as romantic. 

My biggest issue with Vedge wasn't the flavors - they were pretty good. I think it was that I was expecting Horizons again, and this is anything but. Yes, it's Rich Landau, but he's moved up in the world (good for him, I love him!) which means...small, small portions and big, big prices. This is disappointing to me because when the waitress (who was great) told us that she recommended 3 plates per person, I knew we were in trouble. 

The top of the menu was pretty much cold appetizers to share with the table. 3 for $9, it says. Don't think about getting two, or one. If you go with two it's $10. Why? I don't know. The waitress shrugged and said ""I don't know why it's like that."" So we ended up with the pickled cauliflower, fried shisito peppers and the u-peel lupini beans. I was underwhelmed and even left some of the food on the plate. I was just expecting flavors to be punching me in the face, but they were good to graze on while I slugged back the pomegranate sangria. I ordered it because it was least expensive cocktail on the menu. It was pretty to look at, but overall, a forgettable experience.

The hot kitchen items were the stars of the meal and I think if we ever did end up her again we'd just order these and dessert. My boyfriend had the grilled seitan. I remembered getting the grilled seitan at Horizons years ago. It was the best meal I've ever had. The waitress said these plates were bigger. Okay, they're bigger, but they're still too small. The seitan was absolutely divine, and my tofu was out of this world. I loved the marinade it was in. And the edamame puree was super! The sweet potatoes from the dirt list were okay. I liked the coleslaw like veg underneath of them. It was addicting.

I remembered the legendary vegan cheesecake from Horizons, too. A normal slice of cheesecake in size. This time, however, the cheesecake had some sort of waldorf salad celery gel on it (????) and I didn't like that. And the cheesecake was literally 2 bites. We also shared the uber chocolate chunk, and it came with 2 bites of ice cream, 1 bite of chocolate and some sort of pudding. It was good but I was still hungry after my meal.

My hubby and I came here for lunch at an awkward time. We came at about 3 PM on a Saturday. It was super slow and there was a sign to seat yourself when you walk in. We missed this at first and stood there looking around and finally saw it once no one greeted us. We sat at a booth and do not be surprised because they are not comfortable at all. There is no cushion so you sit down on a hard wooden board. I'm sure the high chair tops are just as comfortable as the booths.

For starters we ordered the poutine. I prefer traditional poutine without meat in it but my hubby seemed to like it. It was a good size portion. Then my hubby ordered the jumbo chicken wings, which were not very jumbo in my opinion, just regular size wings. The wings do not come with the sauce already on it. The flavor sauce you order comes on the side along with the dressing. I did not like this because you are dipping the wings twice. I would not order the wings again. I ordered the queso Quattro pizza. The pizza was very good! That was the one thing I enjoyed here.

Their sangria specifically was fantastic. We then moved onto the guac which we created ourselves with assistance. Holy crap. Avocados, crab, onions, roasted garlic, black truffle and jalapeno. It sounds like way too much but holy crap is was amazing. If our meal ended right here, I would give this place 4 stars for sure. Sadly, it did not. 

The short rib tamale was delicious but barely resembled a tamale. The pork carnitas tacos were a bit dry and pale in comparison to my favorite ones at Cantina and the Pollo Fritta was just awful. I swear I can still feel that flavorless dry fried chicken sitting in my stomach 16 hours later. UGH.

My friend from St Louis that's here in Indy now, thought I was in St Louis when I sent a picture. Haha!

The music was LOUD! I could not hear the man behind the counter several times. Which may have led to incorrect food being given to us. Ordered baby back ribs and after cutting into them, they were definitely St Louis ribs. Not the same thing at all. And it had a giant peice of back fat on it. Yuck. St Louis ribs are too rough. I don't like them. The rest of the food was good though-fries, chicken biscuit, Mac and cheese and potato salad. 

I was in there at 8p, they close at 9p, which is SUPER early for downtown Indy on a Friday night. These people working in here were already trying to close up shop!!! Desserts were taken out of the display case and placed in a tub that usually holds dirty dishes. Bread and butter were moved and put away and inaccessible. I didn't feel like asking for it, as they seem preoccupied with fixing their own meals for the end of the night. Hardly any silverware in the tub to take to your table. They yelled at some people walking out to put their trays away and throw away their trash.

The taco was tiny - size of my palm tiny. There are very few options for vegans here. The avocado taco was ok but not worth the $9, with beans included. Their flour tortillas have lard, be careful! I was super happy the waitress knew this. The corn tortilla was a bit bland. One pro tip for you, if you get a soda or like me an iced-tea its free refills.

I did have an issue with the little packets of hoisin sauce being under the noodles. I don't know where those packets have come from or who touched them. Gross. The broth was super flavorful and again, delicious. My first experience was 4 stars! 
My second experience wasn't close to 4 stars. Honestly if this was my first time I'd have a hard time going back. I placed my order over the phone easy-peasy. When I arrived the floors and and a few tables were littered with trash. There was food on the floor and tables, straw wrappers, chopsticks and other bits of trash. I paid for my food and left. This time I decided to try the hot and spicy soup with imitation beef. No veggies, just noodles, ""beef"", and tofu. I also got a side order of fried tofu. The imitation beef was horrendous. It was bland, chewy and inedible honestly. The rice noodles were overcooked and fell apart into tiny pieces as I tried to move them into the soup. The fried tofu side while crisp, was also very bland and came with those annoying packets. The only saving grace was the broth was delicious. I'll give this place another try eventually but I advise everyone avoid the fake meat. Go for the veggies and keep it simple.",2019-04-17 05:47:15

Our first choice for our Anniversary was 4th St Bistro, but they were closed. Many people have raved about how awesome La Famiglia was, so we thought we'd try it out.

I called to make a reservation and spoke with a very disinterested gentleman who made our reservation for 8:30. I had to make him repeat everything back to me so I knew he actually made the reservation. We were running slightly late, so I called to let them know. I was informed by another gentleman that they close the kitchen at 8:45, so I better hurry up. This came across somewhat rude to me, but not a huge deal. 

We arrived at 8:40 and were told by the hostess that the kitchen was closed, but if we ordered something immediately they would open the kitchen and ""throw something together for us."" I informed her that this was our anniversary and we drove 30 minutes to get there and were not looking forward to being rushed. She then told me in a very irritated tone how we should have gotten there earlier and said something about how HER watch said it was 8:50 and restaurant was clearing out. She said something to my girlfriend about how ""Since the restaurant was clearing out, did we really want to eat alone?"" YES, WE WOULD LOVE TO EAT ALONE. We came there for a quiet, romantic dinner, not to make friends and socialize.

We instead went to the Bimini Steakhouse at Peppermill who were MORE than accommodating even though it was slightly later than they generally stay open.

One could rant on the awful racism that is plastered all over the establishment. Another direction could be the deplorable customer service they display even in some of their signage which directs you like you are a three year old.

The easiest and most direct route is the fact that the establishment is nothing more than a glorified tourist trap that has made it's name and money on the backs of others claiming to be ""true Americans"".

For this yelp I'll just focus on the food and leave the other stuff to those with more time on their hands ;)

As many others who have been sucked into this tourist trap I had an expectation of having an excellent authentic Philly Cheesesteak. After all if you didn't grow up in Philly you assume you have only experienced mere imitations at your local sandwich shop or perhaps even frozen food section. Well after eating a cheesesteak from Geno's my first thought was, wow I think I'll stick to the frozen ones.

The cheesesteak tasted a bit like a piece of cardboard you may have munched on when you were five (hey maybe that's why the signs are written that way) with some cheese and lots and lots of grease... Did I mention it was greasy. I was very disappointed but hey it was a $9 learning experience, but for that price I could have picked up two at Wawa and been more satisfied (no, Wawa does not have the best cheesesteaks for those reading this that are not from around here)

Let's face it, no matter what we yelp people will go to Geno's just to say they went there, that's how they stay in business. Just a word to the wise, when you have choked down that greasy cheesesteak, don't bother trying another one, save the 9 bucks for Pat's across the street so you can say you tried them too. Then when your finished with Pat's go and find a real authentic Philly cheesesteak. :) 

If you are wondering where... Hey that's what your yelp is for :) Look up somewhere with good ratings from real Philadelphia residents.

Restaurant was clean, which is what counts.
The important part is all about the food, so, be assured that it's all... They make good shrimp dishes as well as General Tso's Chicken. Their shrimp with vegetables dish is good, but in my opinion, to much Broccoli.

I also had fries with herb parmesan topping, which incidentally costs an extra dollar. It was too much, just made the fries dry and unpleasant to eat. Overall, the burger did taste very good, just not $16.00 good. I had a burger, fries and soft drink, which is $2.50 and the size of a solo cup and, yes, my meal was $16.00.

Oh Chaucer, you with your oriental rugs pinned on the ceiling, your free jukebox and your overall lovely and dive-y charm - how I miss you!  You were a definite memory maker (even though I don't exactly remember everything that happened there - though I'm sure it was commemorated in that photo album they kept at the bar...)

But one must move on.  Pub and Kitchen did, though they kept certain remnants of Chaucers, like the bar and the booths (which I appreciate)  It's definitely airier (and most definitely cleaner) and I love the addition of the two big french doors lending much light to the space.  It's a completely different atmosphere which I like (and at times makes me nostalgic for Chaucer's)

What I'm not nostalgic about was Chaucer's cuisine.  This is where the Pabbit has lept and bounded above the former tenant.  Though a bit expensive, the menu (with its tantalizing bar snacks) is lovely (if not a bit too ambitious).

The bar has got a decent beer and wine selection - and speaking of, I also like that the Pabbit has the beer balls to serve Miller Lite on tap.  Not everyone always wants to drink a belgian or micro brew- sometimes, I like to slum it too (beer-wise, of course)  

The outdoor tables are-a-plenty, and I like the big wood slab that runs alongside the wall from across the bar too- it doubles the bar seating and gives you a place to rest your beverage or your snacks.  

The crowd, as aforementionned in other reviews can tend towards the yupperites, but during the week it is simply pleasant.

 Another over-hyped restaurant that might have been at the height of its hey-day a couple years ago.   Like similar restaurants that have experienced much acclaim, followed by a slow backlash, Osteria is another Italian restaurant that is trying to maintain its once-glowing status and relevancy in a sea of more affordable, and equally-as-good Italian BYOBs.

Excellent, on-point service, save for the less than friendly, obviously bored sommelier and the aloof bartenders.  The atmosphere is decidedly and disappointingly a lot more casual than one would expect. 

The first thing that strikes one is that the entire restaurant space and layout needs to be seriously re-evaluated.  Osteria is huge and the space and flow of the restaurant is very poorly conceived.  There is major congestion right as you enter, and the bar is awkwardly located right in the middle of two dining rooms, past the open kitchen.  Attempting to navigate between the spaces is a total traffic nightmare!  (although, as an aside,  they have lovely, clean bathrooms)  The best dining space is in the extended outdoor conservatory dining room, the rest of the dining spaces are split in three and they are tightly packed with tables with a scorching high noise level.

The menu has Vetri brilliance, here and there, especially in the pasta dishes.  The rest of the menu, and for the price tag, does not live up to the Vetri hype.  Nothing on the antipasti menu ever has blown me away, and the Pizza (always hailed as some of the best pizza around), is good, yes, but nothing that knocks your socks off.  In all seriousness, this pizza is maybe only a notch better than pizza at Pietro's.  The pasta, as expected, is really what shines.   Whichever dish you choose, you cannot go wrong there.   

Lastly, they serve one of my favorite deserts ever: the polenta budino with gianduia mousse and candied hazelnuts - if you're a fan of any of these ingredients, I command you to order this!  The cold polenta, and the sweet and salty mix of flavors with the mousse and hazelnuts is downright heavenly.

As you know this place isn't a cheap night out. With cocktails, wine, appetizer & pizza to split, two main dishes and desert to to split for 2 will cost you a pretty penny .  This place, despite some high points, just isn't all that it is cracked up to be (or perhaps once was).

The beautiful wife and I finally visited Lola on this hot steamy summer evening.  Walking in, it was fairly empty except for some patrons at the bar.  We were promptly greeted and after wandering about trying to find a table that wasn't in sunlight.

After perusing the menu for a bit, we ordered a couple of drinks (I'll let the beautiful wife review her food and drinks).  I had the Bogen (Don Q Coco Rum with pineapple juice and iced tea).  It was pretty refreshing, especially coming out of the heat.

For an appetizer, we split the spanakopita/portobello dish.  It's spanakopita, wrapped in phyllo, on top of a grilled portobello.  The entire thing is on top of a giant crouton like thing.  And surrounded by a bunch of greens.

Anyway, it's a wonderful blend of flavors and textures.  And it's pretty rich, so splitting isn't a bad idea.

For an entree, I saw they had the infamous lobster corn dog (which will be available via the Yelp Eats! menu -- see http://www.yelp.com/events/saint-louis-yelp-eats).  This also comes with mac and cheese (more about it later).

The lobster corn dog wasn't what you'd think -- it was a small lobster tail, deep fried (?) in a light corn (I assume) breading.  I thought this was pretty tasty, but it was...

1) really small
2) the fried aspect made it taste sort of cheap (there's that mental thing of associating fried seafood with lesser quality)

Fortunately, this is served with a hefty portion of above-mentioned mac and cheese.  This is really good stuff -- very light, but very tasty.

A couple more drinks were consumed:

1) the Castro (Dos Lunas Anejo Tequila, Cointreau, fresh muddled limes and a float of Grand Marnier) -- nice punch to this, but very boozy (be warned)

2) Moto Lofts (Habanero infused Absolut vodka and house Mary mix) -- oh good lord.   This is it.  This is the best freaking Bloody Mary in St. Louis.  Tabasco, you ain't got shit on Habanero.

Service was very friendly and quick to keep drinks filled (Lola may sip, Timothy drinks).  What impressed me was the pacing of the food -- we had nice pauses between courses and never felt rushed.

I just don't know about this place -- I've walked out of there going ""two stars, not going back!"" to well, going back and thinking ""four stars, can't wait to come here again!""

So I'm going with three stars -- there's consistently been enough positives and negatives that they balance out.

Here's a series of thoughts:

1) I like the pinxtos at happy hour (bar area only) -- if you're feeling cheap and/or looking for something to nibble on before moving to another destination, you can get a lot of food for fairly cheap.

2) But, some of the items aren't that great. I'd say that if you see something has aioli on it, chances are, it's going to be pretty tasteless. As the beautiful wife noted in her review, the mushrooms, oysters, and chicken wings are all solid.

3) The happy hour drink specials are OK -- I wish that they'd offer specials on their regular wines by the glass, but that's just me. The Spanish beers they have are by the bottle and are both lighter (I believe a lager and a pilsner). The funniest thing they offer is the $2.50 half pint for draft beer. Maybe that's some traditional thing in Spain, but good lord, it just screams ""stupid.""

4) Dish of note: the Bistec a la Cabrales (grilled hanger steak with Cabrales cheese and port reduction) -- this was delicious. The steak was perfectly done and the sweetness of the reduction balanced out the cheese nicely. And you get a pretty decent-sized portion for $8.00

5) Service has ranged from friendly to indifferent. Indifferent made one happy hour not so happy. Why so gloomy? Maybe it's all the cheap people who come in and order 10 millions things for $8? Buck up camper, you could be working at another establishment on the Hill and poisoning people with Provel.

6) Lots of parking in their own lot and/or the street.

7) Cocktails -- the coconut caipirinha is wacky delicious. The rest of the cocktail menu is heavy on sweet drinks, so I've just stuck with beer and wine.

Though I know we'll visit here again, I'll always be skeptical of what experience we're about to have...",2011-11-18 17:42:49

And dammit, the onion rings (the rings here own Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits) and service made me knock this up to 3.

So, the beautiful wife and I played ""tourist"" on the weekend.  After getting dicked over by Hard Rock, we went to Landry's.  My first though on entering was ""I feel underdressed"" -- then I remembered, I'm a tourist, I can do whatever I want.

The beautiful wife and I started off with seafood stuffed jalapenos, which were awkward at best.  BUT, they came on top of a beautiful, HUGE pile of thin onion rings.  Yay!  They were great.  Huge fan.  As in I'd drag the wife here and sit at the bar, drink and eat these.

On to the entree -- I had the Seafood Grill -- veggies and seafood grilled.  It was fine.  Better than Red Lobster, worse than just about any other seafood place.  But the scallops on this platter were excellent.  And apparently, I ate ""Pontchartrain"" but based on what other reviewers have written, this is Tilapia or a related poop-eating fish.  At least I expect to eat poopfish at a place like Landy's.

Anyway, it's a tourist place (and priced accordingly) for those who end up staying at Union Station and don't know where else to go.  You can do worse than Landry's, but you can do a lot better.",2010-06-07 01:54:26

The beautiful wife and I hit Talayna's for dinner tonight.  When we walked in, we were asking smoking or non-smoking.  We went with no, but then it turned into some sort of situation regarding what server didn't have enough tables.  So we interrupted and went with smoking, just so we could sit.

We got a booth in the bar area, which is vacant, except for one fellow sitting by himself in a booth in the corner.  I don't believe he ordered any food or drink, so I'm not sure if he was real or not.

Anyway, we were deciding on what to drink, and per some discussions earlier, we decided it would be a wine night.  I asked about that and our server presented a wine list.  I swear, I'd kill to have a picture of this.  It was literally a handwritten list that pretty much read ""Cabernet, Chardonnay, Chianti...""  And of course, lacking prices.  Crazy.

I ordered a bottle of Chianti, because I'm a lush.  Only to have the server come back and say they don't sell wine by the bottle.  Even better.  Two glasses of Chianti please!

We had some jalapeno poppers to start off with, which were fine.  They have a mix of cheddar and cream cheese.  But, before you get too comfy, they come with a side of marinara.  That's a first.  But hey, they must know something, because the cream cheese poppers with marinara had a pseudo-lasagna taste (well, jalapeno lasagna).

What happened next...it's so hard to talk about.  You see, they brought out a pizza sample.  A sample of St. Louis style pizza.  That's right.  Sitting before us was a bubbling, thin crusted, Provel-topped monstrosity.   What we were to do?  Reject it entirely?  Run?  Claim to be vegans?  As you see often with travel shows, it would be offensive to your hosts if you did not to take a nibble.  So we did.  From the very edge.  I can't say or not if any of that bastard cousin of Cheese Whiz entered my system, but it came close enough.

After some moments of awkwardness, the main event arrived -- a medium, New York style deluxe pizza.  Wait, no.  It was a medium deluxe pizza, but it wasn't New York-style.  This was a thicker crust, cut into narrow pieces.

Now, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't New York-style.  It reminded me more of a better version of Pizza Hut's hand-tossed (yeah, I've traveled down that road, still better than Provel-topped garbage).

Really long story short, it wasn't bad, it wasn't great.  If we wanted a simple, no frills pizza experience, we might come back (or order take out).  But it didn't blow me away.",2010-12-11 02:37:11

Nam Van is not the BEST Pho in town, but it's a pretty good standby for the neighborhood.

We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Their Chinese lunch specials are valid even on the weekends (sweet!), but on a chilly fall day, we had our sights set on soup.

We started with the spring rolls. Though not as tightly wrapped as some others I've had, all the usual suspects were included: cucumber, lettuce, rice noodles, pork, and shrimp enclosed in rice paper served with a yummy chili sauce. I'm accustomed to a peanut sauce with spring rolls, so I was missing that a little, but still good nonetheless. 

To drink, we got a Vietnamese iced coffee as well as an Avocado Boba Snow (like a smoothie.) The iced coffee was, again, not served as usual (with that metal contraption that slowly drips the fresh coffee into the condensed milk) - it was pre-made. Still tasty though. The Boba was solid and as good as elsewhere.

I got the combo bun (rice noodle bowl) with beef, shrimp, and egg roll. While they forgot the eggroll, both the beef and shrimp were cooked perfectly. Tasty bowl of food, but a bit underwhelming at about $11. Other Vietnamese places serve quite a bit more food for that price.

My sister got a small bowl of Pho with Rare Beef and added veggies to round it out. The veggies and beef were excellent. However, what should've been the star of the dish - the broth - was disappointing. It did not have the umami and depth of flavor that Pho should. It was salty and warming, but the whole thing reminded me more of a Wonton soup instead of a great Pho bowl.

Overall, I like this place and would come again if I was in the area. However, I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Lucky for us, the Pho market here is competitive!",2017-11-06 23:13:07

We like to try out new-ish eating experiences as a group and as usual, this place was a lot of fun.  I'm pretty sure each of the 34 of us over-ate.  My mom echoed an admission of the same guilt and said ""gluttony is the only sin you pay right away"".  I agree.

The entire staff at Percy St BBQ was incredibly attentive, welcoming and friendly.  Percy St. made it clear immediately that they're the place for large groups.  Before the meal the chef, Erin O'Shea, came out to welcome us and introduce the authentic southern cuisine she obviously puts a lot of love into.  We started off with some tasty appetizers: the Jalapeño Cheddar Cornbread, Avocado Salad, & the Devil Eggs which we devoured with the last gulps of our happy hour (5-7pm) drinks.   Honestly, after that I have no clear account of how things wen since we were getting the full Lockhart dinner treatment.  The blitzkrieg-like storm of delicious food seemed never ending.  The dishes of sides were passed around, each new flavor to fit onto our plates.  Dishes were replaced, trays carried out with paper-wrapped goodness that would be all the meat dishes.  The ribs, pork belly, sausage, roast chicken and brisket were each passed around and I watch my platter fill with goodness.  I almost completely forgot to photograph any food due to the feeding frenzy I slipped into.  In my opinion, all the food was really good.  It was all far too good to fill up on the white bread provided to each table, despite knowing it's Texas authentic. 

Though I left there loosening my belt and groaning, I was already planning my return for some choice dishes that had me in this state more than anything.  The avocado salad (because it seemed kind of healthy),   the mac and cheese (because it was way too good to be healthy!), the brisket (it's their most hyped dish that still exceeds said hype - being so damn juicy, tender and flavorful) , the pork belly (crazy good) and the pecan pie (for it's perfect balance of sweet and salty, chewy goodness).  Just re-reading this paragraph, I'm feeling full again and yet still wondering if I could fit in the root beer chili, which to me was also perfect with hot and spicy balanced with just the right hint of root beer.

The restaurant was so cold, both my friend and I had to keep our jackets on. When I say cold, I'm talking sixty degrees cold on a normal winter day. I asked why it was so cold and they said their heating system was only two units on the wall. I found this to be unacceptable and now realize why they had blocked the front door. They didn't seem to care about fixing the issue or be very apologetic about the matter. The food was also slightly pricey.

We stopped here on St. Patrick's Day evening around 7:30-8pm and it seemed pretty slow. The three of us stood at the hostess stand for several minutes watching employees stop by to grab menus and leave, not one said a word to us or even bothered to see if anyone was standing by the door. Someone eventually came to take us to a seat and she seemed like she would rather have been literally anywhere else. We were not greeted cheerfully or told any specials, were not brought water, nothing. We just sat at our table for several more minutes waiting for anyone to greet us. 

I'm going to pause right here and say that from here on out I take full responsibility for staying to find out what happened next. All three of us knew exactly what type of dinner we were going to have from this point forward, and we still chose to stay and see what happened next. We read the warning signs, and then promptly disregarded them.

There was muffled music playing on a speaker, it seemed like it was coming from behind the door we were sitting near but it gave the whole room a really strange vibe. Eventually our server came over and she was extremely pleasant and it was actually surprising to have someone in the restaurant be welcoming to us. We were all disappointed that the prices were quite high for the meat and didn't include any sides, and the sides were very pricey, in our minds. We ordered drinks, we ordered food (brisket tacos to start, a corned beef and cabbage special, and a fried chicken sandwich with french fries for me, one of us didn't have dinner, just drinks). The drinks, appetizers, and meal came out all at once. The brisket tasted good, but the slice of meat inside the tortilla was super weird and awkward. There was also just no other flavors with the tacos. There was some cabbage, and of course we were given hot sauce and 4 or 5 different barbecue sauces, but for the price of the 3 tacos I would not say they were worth it at all. 
The corned beef and cabbage special was $12 and there was so much fat on the corned beef I think my brother in law ate 1/2 of it and we fed the rest to our dogs at home. It was a bit tough, not super flavorful. The cabbage was undercooked. He was very disappointed. 
My fried chicken sandwich: I have never in my life had fried chicken that tasted like chalk, but that was the texture of the breading on the chicken and there was NO seasoning in it whatsoever. I added a ton of salt and Lawry's Seasoning to my sandwich, which helped. The bread was SO dry, and the sandwich was so boring I almost fell asleep eating it. 
Here's where we should talk BBQ sauces: the Carolina sauce was just mustard and vinegar. I can't imagine there being one other ingredient in that sauce because it was potently vinegar and mustard. The other sauces were either vinegar or sweet, indistinguishable. 

Now for the fries: for $3.50 I got a very small boat of what I would consider the world's worst french fries. These fries were so saturated with oil it was dripping out of them. They were also cold when I got them. There was a very nice server (manager?) who came up and asked us how everything was tasting and I was honest with him about the fries. He was super apologetic and told me that Brother John's appreciates feedback from their customers. He told met he fries would be taken off the bill and they were removed from the table. A few minutes later he came over with a $10 gift card to return and apologized again. I thought this was a super nice gesture, but because the rest of our food was so grim and the atmosphere was so sad I couldn't bear to break it to him that we probably won't ever return. No bother, because when the bill came to our table we were still charged for the fries. We didn't dispute it. We just paid and left.

But I ate here three times prior to reviewing, and I have to be honest. The first two times the food was great and the service was decent, but the last time was so terrible that it knocked this review down to two stars. 

I'll say it again to be fair: the beers are great, the beer selection is wonderful and changes often, and the flatbreads are really, really good. I've had some appetizers here like soup, salad, edamame, cheese, and olives and they've always been tasty. 

But this third time...first, I ordered an olive appetizer which was way different than it had been before. Before, it had been a small, tasty serving of various olives. This time, it was a large bowl of completely tasteless olives. I actually sent it back, and I have NEVER sent back a dish in any restaurant. The waiter seemed surprised and made me explain myself several times, which I didn't think was necessary. But whatever, I had a delicious flatbread coming.

Except that it never came. All of my dining companions received their food and were nearly finished by the time we even got an explanation. In fact, it seemed as if the waiter was avoiding us. Finally he came over and said that there was a ""mix up"" and the pizza would be out in mere minutes. Well, it wasn't mere minutes, but it finally came. I received an apology from two waitstaff about it, and the offer of a free dessert.

Well, okay. I can accept that. I ordered the banana chocolate chip bread pudding. And it took FOREVER to come out. It became comical. I assume they only had to heat it. It took so long that we were just amused at that point. And when it arrived, it was very, very burnt. I received a burnt end. 

I try not to hate on anything ""free,"" but when your free comped dessert takes forever to arrive and is BURNT, what is one to do?

Two out of three weren't bad, but they weren't good either.",2009-08-13 02:36:25

They were huge Liga MX soccer fans.  So if there is a big game on TV that day, they close early.

So on a whim, I checked and a lot of the soccer games start at 7:00pm.

No one came to our table to see if we wanted anything to drink other than the water they placed at our table while we were in the buffet line and no one offered us any naan. I watched every other table (some with just one diner) receive a basket of naan. The only time we saw a server was to ask for the check.

I came with a group, but I shared meals with my boyfriend.  I ordered the special, the nachos with chicken confit, and my boyfriend ordered the andouille sausage po' boy.  

I was surprised when my nachos came out to find very little chicken on the dish.  There wasn't much cheese or salsa either!  There was, however, a dollop of weird sour cream/ranch topping that did not compliment the rest of the dish.  The nachos were just cheap, store-bought yellow tortilla chips with a hint of cheese and chicken.  What is the point of ordering nachos if you don't even have a decent layer of cheese?!  I make far better nachos at home with better ingredients, better topping-to-chip ratios, and more topping variety.

My boyfriend's po' boy was not good either.  The bread was noticeably stale.  The sausage was bland.  It came with fries that were giant; they were essentially a potato cut into 4 gigantic slices and then fried.  If we had wanted a baked potato, we would've ordered that.

We ate the food because we were starved.  However, I expect food at restaurants to be tastier and of a higher quality than what I make at home (and I'm a beginner).  This food was much, much worse than my cooking.

I have never been disappointed at Oceano. It was Thanksgiving and my husband and I were going to be on our own. No point in cooking...how about something non-traditional? With Dungeoness crab in season, we thought it time to go to Oceano for their amazing crab and shrimp melt. It was a good choice! Perfect temperature, melty and on sourdough. A very nice dill component that is not overpowering made the sammich fresh and yummy. They also have great fries that are always super hot. This sammy is big enough to share, fyi. With a bottle of chardonnay, our Thanksgiving lunch did not disappoint.

Pro's: Location, adequate sushi (see below)

Con's: Dirty, juvenile service, slow kitchen (hot kitchen, not sushi), no effort over years to remedy this, calamari is cooked from frozen

Go back? If I want adequate sushi, must sit by river and don't mind trash all around on the ground (patio and indoors - I took a video of this but it will not upload).

Sunday, May 21, approximately 7:00PM, party of 2

It was an ok time with some irritations noted below. Mostly, I could not help noticing the trash that servers neglected to pick up on the patio and indoors. I am talking chop sticks, chop stick wrappers, napkins, sushi order forms. This was true indoors as well. Why are servers not instructed or simply not picking up trash? If this is not important in the front of the house, what can the kitchen look like? Hate to think about that one... There is a lovely commercial grade carpet at the door with the Reef logo. It is trashed, dirty, needs to be cleaned or replaced. Such a pretty logo but brown with dirt.

""What do you mean by that?"":

Juvenile service: Ordered AYCE and sushi came out well before appetizers. Discussed this with server and was told the ""hot"" kitchen is always slower than the sushi kitchen. So I said ""Well then maybe appetizer orders should be put in before sushi orders."" Her response? ""Yes, you should definitely do that."" So this was MY bad. How about asking us for apps when you asked for our drink order? Come to think of it, over 3.5 years of going to Reef maybe twice a year, this has happened every time. After years of this, is there no remedy? How about a separate slip of paper for appetizer orders kept separate from the long sushi order? This way, apps could be turned into the kitchen well ahead of sushi orders.

Reef has an amazing location and some fun roll combinations that are tasty. Quality of maguro was a lower grade, however. Maguro should be as red as rare meat. This was pink. I hate to see the ""draw"" of the river be what keeps this restaurant alive. Imagine the draw of the river AND amazing sushi, service in a clean environment?

This review is specifically for the new Rancharrah location. I have eaten there twice this week! The first time, I had the Croque Madame....eu la la! So fresh and delicious. The fries are great...can't wait to try the truffle fries sometime soon. I loved it so much, I brought my husband out on Saturday. He had the fish and eggs and LOVED it. I had the cheddar grits with a fried egg and all the other yummies they added to that bowl. Amazing! How do they get a fried egg to look like it is sunny-side up, but is not, but is still cooked right to the edge of the yolk? Unbelievable! The creativity of unique flavors found here is refreshing and a real treat. Sunday morning, I woke up wanting more Perenn but know I can't eat cheddar grits every day...but I was really craving their dark roast COFFEE. Wow. I can go back for coffee...and maybe a little chocolate bouchon.

It was busy when we were there on Saturday. There was a table but it had no chairs. The server went and fetched chairs from outside without our even asking.

There is also a market area where we bought fig and rosemary garlic bread. That was amazing with dinner last night? Who thinks of these combos? So delicious! We also bought the pistachio and pork pate....YUM! Husband wanted the sardines...I'm sure he will like them - not my thing.

There was a mistake on my order which was quickly rectified and to make amends, they gave me a chocolate chip cookie. You guys can screw up my order ANY TIME! Hahahaha.

I'm not a sports fan, so the TVs aren't really my thing.  But I think of it as something of a sports bar/ restaraunt, so I don't necessarily think they're out of place.  (I know that's not how they advertise, but the TVs make it so.)  

I've had variable experience with the service.  They're always nice, but sometimes they're *very* slow.  We've had them forget to put in the order of one person or another at the table multiple times.  They typically don't charge for the meal they forget and add a free dessert when they do that, at least, but you'd think they'd do something to preven the problem in the first place...  It is loud in here during busy times, but it fits in with my thinking of it as a sports bar.  Not a good place for quiet conversation, that's for sure.

I do like the food.  I can't think of a time I've been disappointed with it...  The pizzas are wonderful (though they do take awhile; order a salad to start with!), the salads are great, the sandwiches are decent, and the pasta dishes are delicious.  Not a huge selection of desserts (who doesn't have cheesecake???), but what you can get is good.  

Be prepared for a wait if you go Friday or Saturday night!  They do sometimes offer samples of their food (typically pizza) when they know they're telling people long wait times; that's always nice.  I recommend trying BJs, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because service issues are my big pet peeve.",2010-06-23 15:55:15

Maybe it was the fact that I (and everyone else) was soaked, and stinky, and miserable... but this place seemed a bit too cramped for my style.  The place is long and narrow which forces everyone to squish past one another to get to the bar.  I liked how they had a side bar set up in the back, which helped... but not really.

After a while we were able to snag a table in the back, and we ordered a pretzel off of the regular menu (with gouda cheese, nom nom).  Not too sure what the waitress heard, because she brought us the regular pretzel off of the Sips menu... and we were fine with that considering the sips pretzel was much cheaper, or so we thought.  When we got the bill, what did we see?  We were charged for the gouda pretzel.  Malarkey!  The waitress apologized but basically said there was nothing she could do.  

Meh.  If the gang wanted to hit this place back up again I'm sure I'd tag along... but I'll probably take my german cravings elsewhere.",2013-07-10 15:03:05

It was delicious.Very spicy yes!!! w/a nice lemongrass kick. Didn't care much for the tendons, and wished there was some more beef, but it was very enjoyable.The noodles(wheat) were thick and al dente.

The woman who owns  the place was very helpful and friendly. She was stuffing wontons as she explained the other soups on the menu.They all sounded great! Menu is small- mostly pho, banh mi, rice platters and 5 other soups containing noodles or wontons.

Today was not an exception.  I went with a couple of friends after work (neither had been to Pita J prior) and we were ready for some yummy tapas and drinks.  We sat on the patio, which is a must in Tucson during the fall!  We were one of three tables on the patio and inside had very little patrons.  We ordered our drinks and food promptly.  The drinks came and were correct.  Our food arrived (my olives were forgotten) but we did not have silverware.  In due time, our server came and noticed we didn't have silverware.  She brought it and eventually my olives came.  Round two.  My friends ordered a 2nd drink but I did not.  Our server brought their drinks and emptied more wine into my glass that was not quite empty yet.  Weird. I never ordered a 2nd glass but yet was charged for the 2nd glass.  I may have eventually ordered another glass but I didn't at that point.  My friends requested separate checks, as we were paying with cards and the server put an additional item on my check.

As we pulled in I remembered this location as a marvelous Cafe from years ago. The parking is limited in front to 4 spots with additional parking in the back. They have steps on one side of the entrance with a large ramp on the another side. This is an older, large, two story house with small interior rooms. Seating consists of several regular height tables and 4 high top tables.

Our server was top-notch and took our drink orders immediately while distributing two sushi and a Japanese menu.  

Each lunch category has 5 different selections to choose from. The Benton Box ($12.95) and Lunch Entrees ($9.95) options are served with miso soup, salad and rice. The Sushi Lunches ($14.95) are served with miso soup and salad. The Noodle Lunches ($9.95) are served with salad only. For larger appetizers they serve the Japanese favorite Bento Boxes. Tokohama also offers a 5 Vegetarian options and a large selection of Sushi rolls.

We ordered the 6 piece Veggie Tempura ($9), 5 piece Gyoza ($6 fried dumplings), Miso Soup, 8 piece Volcano Roll ($17) and Yaki Udon soup ($9)  which came with a salad/ginger dressing.

The Veggie Tempura had large veggie pieces deep fried to a light golden brown.  The homemade Gyoza, deep fried or pan seared, Japanese Pork Dumplings were my favorite appetizer. The wonderful house sauce was delicious on the savory deep fried pork dumplings. The salad was very fresh and crisp with ginger dressing and the miso soup was very flavorful. The Yaki Udon Beef soup, (enough for 3 if sharing) was served in a large, hot pot with sauteed veggies, slices of beef and Japanese thick noodles. The thick noodles are much easier to attempt with chop sticks. The Volcano Roll was luscious with different layers of flavors from the shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, asparagus and topped with cooked shrimp. The roll has just a touch of spice. The Volcano Roll presentation was in a foil sail boat shape. Adorable!! All of the dishes had such thoughtful presentations. Everything was delicious and we were so full after lunch!! But we didn't regret one bite.

Yokohama have two terrific rooms upstairs for larger groups and each room sits 14 comfortably. The rooms have large screen TVs and are equipped for Karaoke. 8 or more people are needed to reserve a room. They request reservations, or least 24 hr advance notification, in order to have one dedicated server. 

I look forward to returning to sample different sushi rolls, especially the Tsunami Roll. We both loved the food and the service was excellent. 

Lunch is served 11 - 2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Dinner is served 4 p.m. - 9 p.m. Monday through Friday. Saturday and Sunday dinner is served 2 - 9 p.m. Don't miss this little gem in Greenwood on Madison Ave.",2018-12-07 22:59:42

Street parking is available on 22nd Street or Delaware. As you enter the restaurant you'll see the carryout window. Turn left and go thru the door and you'll be directly in front of the hostess stand. The large, full bar is attractive and to the right as you enter. 

Seating consists of large booths,  banquette seating, bar and weather permitting, patio seating. Large groups could be seated on the banquette seating if all available.

The menu has a wonderful selection from the complimentary chips and salsa to jalapeno poppers, ten buffalo chicken wings to nachos with steak, chicken and shrimp loaded with toppings. If you prefer fries to chips try the Crazy Nachos with beef or chicken. The Guacamole Fresco is so fresh and filled with flavor. If you like Guacamole try this generous appetizer. 

The menu offers a lunch menu as well as the entrees we all love. Several versions of salads, quesadillas, burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas or 3 tacos with rice and charro beans cover many of the entrees. Fajitas and Loco's specialities round out the menu. The Chili Colorado is one of my husband's favorites. A Tilapia filet, Fajita Fish, Seafood Enchiladas or Cameron's de la Diabla is available for those looking for seafood. The Tio's Combo is popular with a chicken burrito, enchilada and chimichanga all smothered in chili con queso. The Seafood Enchiladas or the Enchiladas Ranchero are two of my favorites.

The warm and charming staff makes it a goal to ensure that every experience is one to remember, and you can tell it's not just a job for them. It's a lifestyle. Every server, bartender and employee I've had an interaction with genuinely enjoys being a part of the team and is thrilled to have you walk through the door. 

The bartenders are bar geniuses. I haven't had a bad drink. The summer cocktail menu is one you won't want to miss. As for wine drinkers, the selection is impressive and the servers are happy to assist in the perfect pairing for your meal.

The food - you'll want to come hungry. The server will bring a few different breads, three butter options and an olive oil dipping plate. The wasabi butter is my personal favorite, but it's all delicious. The Tuna Tar Tar is a must for a starter, but don't stop there. Get a few appetizers to start, perhaps the Artichoke Flower Salad or the Sweet Breads. 

No matter what steak you order, it will be cooked to perfection. If you're unsure of the best cook on a cut, ask your server and they'll be happy to offer a suggestion. For those not into steak, there are other options including chicken, sea bass and more. Share a few sides with your entree. My personal favorite are the Root Purée, Truffled Polenta and the Truffle Fries. No matter what you order, in my experience, you can't go wrong.

Somehow the lunch plans changed from sushi, to pizza, and ultimately ended on this place.  NOT my choice, as seafood restaruants offer no variety for vegetarians, but I went along, figuring I'd try something new, and perhaps would be pleasantly surprised.

Unfortunately, that was not the case.  From the time we walked in, til the time we left, it was one dissapointment after another.  First, even though the restaurant was almost empty, we had to wait for them to clear a booth for us, even though there were PLENTY of clear booths, the hostess clearly *had* to seat us in a specific section.  As a former hostess and waitress, I get that, but I would never had made a customer wait just so I could keep the section rotation in line.  You seat the people, and fix the rotation next go-round.

As far as the rest of the service, it was pretty slow in general.  Our waitress seemed like a nice enough person, but just didn't have a certain level of professionalism I expect.  

Next, as expected, the selection of vegetarian meals was limited.  In fact, I found just one - the black bean and veggie quesadilla.   (Admittedly, it may be unfair for me to judge a place on this particular criteria, since their main thing is seafood, but it's my review and I'll judge how I want!)  When the question of what was included with the meal arose (that section of the menu said it came with a choice of fries, cole slaw, or a salad), she said that that particular meal did not come with that selection, rather ""Spanish stuff.  Like rice and stuff.""  When I got my meal, there was no rice or other ""Spanish stuff"" other than the quesadilla itself, and some pico de gallo.

The next offense was my brother-in-law's meal.  He ordered a turkey club, and specified no tomatos.  The club arrived with tomatos.  The waitress blamed the cook and took it back.  The cook clearly just removed the tomatos, rather than re-make the sandwich.  When my BIL called her out on that, she asked ""do you have an allergy?""  It doesn't matter - he asked for no tomatos!  Then she tried telling him that the red stuff he saw on the sandwich was not tomato, but cranberry sauce or something.  Whatever.  BIL is, btw, in the restaurant industry and admittedly a tough critic, but the way she handled this situation was poor.

When it was time for the check, we had a long wait.  The next major problem was that she charges us for an extra appetizer that we did not order, and had to wait another 10 minutes for her to bring us a new check.  Ugh.  The manager did give us some $10 coupons to use, but I an assure you that we won't be using them.",2011-01-23 21:39:26

The room is available for rental, and it has two long tables, along with a few small square tables, and can probably fit about 20 people comfortably.

The décor inside the upper room is very drab and old, and not a place I would ever think of hosting my own party.  It reminds me of an aged party room at a Round Table Pizza parlor, where the walls always seem to be off white and the lighting is never good.

On other hand, the food they serve is not bad.  We had pre-made burritos and chips and soft-shell tacos and salsa available.  The burritos are large and stuffed full of refried beans and cheese.  It's definitely a mouthful and fills you up very fast.  The spicy salsa is DELICIOUS, and something that I enjoyed very much.  The chips are just your basic restaurant-grade tortilla chips - nothing to write home about.

Overall, the décor is nothing to celebrate, and falls far short of the normal expectation for a place where an celebration is taking place, but the food is the saving grace of this place and keeps the rating at three stars.",2017-04-03 03:05:08
