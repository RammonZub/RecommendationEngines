Although I have been here numerous times years before, I took a 7 year hiatus due to another pho place I have been frequenting.

For a change of pace, I ordered the lemon grass pork chop with broken rice and another guest ordered the pho. The meal was under $20 which was a great deal, but I'm more experienced in Vietnamese food now and I can say that this is average.

The lemon grass pork chop was flavorful, but the effort put into this dish left something to be desired. The fish sauce was too sweet to a point of scratching at one's throat and the pork chop was not marinated enough for the flavors to seep in. I also enjoyed the chop to be slightly caramelized around the edges but this was just cooked with the tiniest bits of caramelization.

In addition, the pho broth was neither rich nor flavorful. It seems to inherit the spices and bones of a good broth, but simply wasn't simmered long enough for the delicate, savory, bone flavors to seep in.

In addition to the mediocre dishes, the restaurant itself was cramped and sticky. There was almost no breathing space between your table and your neighbors and the AC was not strong enough to accommodate the crowd we had that day on a hot summer afternoon.

Overall, this place had the potential to be better, but didn't seem like it wanted to try. It certainly could fool any tourists or pho newbie, but I'd have to pass on this one.",2017-08-14 21:06:12

But I reality wanted this spot to be my go to for games especially March Madness... I'm not in love and I'm not complaining. 

Here's the reality - the TV's are great and everywhere! That's what you want, right? And they are quick to change your TV for you to get you glued to the game you want to watch. 
The space is huge and has a lot of open door fresh air type of feel which is nice for those that want to remember that the outdoors still exist while watching the games. 
The kitchen provided some pretty decent bar food and with ample servings (though I still ate every french fry). 
The crowd was a nice balance of ages, backgrounds and energy levels - all with great positive vibes. 
Really the only downside that I saw was the service. It was unclear who was serving who and often we would wait in a not crowded bar for 5 minutes before anyone engaged with us.

I ordered a bowl of the thai green curry mussels.  The sauce was creamy, bright, and very flavorful.  Definitely not shy on the green curry front. For my second bowl of mussels, I ordered the white wine/garlic sauce - which was also very flavorful and packed with the garlicky flavor you'd expect.

I am not a mussels expert by any means, but was definitely expecting more broth/sauce than what I got.  The sauces were just drizzled over top of the mussels, whereas I was expecting them to be sitting in a considerable amount of broth or liquid (in which I could dip my bread/roll or use to sauce my linguine.)

My husband got a 10 oz sirloin, he again liked the flavor of his steak but his wasn't evenly cooked , he also had the issue with the excessive pepper but on his fries.

The GOOD:
Our service was fantastic.  The biscuits and jam were great.  The pork chop and steeplechase pie were both good.  Fried green tomatoes were pretty good.  They would've been much better had they been crispy.

The BAD:
Hot chicken was awful.  It was so salty it was totally not edible.  The regular chicken was decent.  Mac & Cheese and hash brown casserole were plain and nothing special.  Chess pie was not good at all.  It was very bland.  The fudge pie was decent.  

The WORST part is that we were told the wait was 35 minutes and we waited DOUBLE that. 

Overall, the place is decent.  The biscuits were the only thing that made this place special.  If I happen to be out there and there was no wait I might consider stopping.  However, I would NEVER EVER wait longer than 5 minutes for Cracker Barrel level food.",2021-07-02 23:31:29

Breakfast in downtown New Orleans, what could go wrong? Luckily for us, relatively little. Parking is a bit of a nightmare, bit of a death trap, but that comes with the territory.

It's a tiny place, just FYI. We didn't have to wait at all for a table for a party of four, but if there was a rush you're just going to have to wait outside I guess.

Service was friendly, but you care about the food, don't you? You and your unsatisfied mouth.

French Toast Monte Cristo was good. It wasn't overly sweet (which surprised me since everything down here seems to be overly sweet) and struck a good balance with not only the flavors but the textures as well.

Biscuits and gravy were delicious, though very heavy so we could barely finish them.

I also go to try the Huevos Rancheros, which got a ""meh"" from my wife for being a bit too cold of a dish. I thought it was just okay.

I ordered the four meat sampler with my chosen choices being dark meat chicken quarter, pulled pork, St. Louis ribs and an unusual item being their Montreal corned beef.  Sides of potato salad and cole slaw.  My one big thing was the Q was done in Hickory (easy to tell) and they said some apple too.  My two least favorite woods but I will say they did a good job with it.  Not over smoked.  I'm an oak fan or more like an anything but hickory fan, sorry.  Having said that the chicken was a little over cooked and dry.  Dark meat chicken should never be dry.  Nice flavor however.  Pulled pork was good.  Hand pulled and some nice bark and nice rub flavor.  Ribs were over done and fall off the bone but if you like that, great.  Judges look for clean pull but not fall off.  Flavor was very good and a very nice flavor rub.  Not sauced which is also good.  Let the customer choose his sauce.  The two sauces were excellent and I would love the recipes.  The Ancho BBQ was tasty with a little vinegar tang.  The Memphis had some nice pepper notes.  I plan to do a tasting next time of all their sauces.  Will be worth the extra charge to try them.  The Montreal corned beef was really tasty.  Years ago I was told to try it if I ever got the chance when I was in Canada.  I can't vouch for authenticity but I can vouch for it being really good.  I have cooked close to 5000 lbs of regular corned beef in my life for my club and this was cooked perfectly.  The slaw while fresh and nice looking was just not my favorite flavor profile.  Not knocking it at all.  Just not for me,  The potato salad was good. 
Service on the porch was very good.  Didn't go inside so can't comment on the inside or bathrooms.  Lots of fans on the porch making the heat tolerable.  
While my gold standard for restaurant BBQ is LeAnn Whippens Deviled Pig in Tampa, that is a long drive.  So would I go back which in a nutshell is my key? Very much so.  Close to the house, above average BBQ, exceptional sauces, nice seating, very prompt efficient friendly staff.  I would bring friends here anytime and expect it would be a pleasant experience.

Took some friends and went back today for lunch.  Friend had wedge salad with pulled pork upgrade. She enjoyed it very much and a healthy portion of pulled pork. A little pricey though.  Tried the brisket chili and it was excellent. Even better than mine.  Baked beans were also first rate.  Tried spicy ancho sauce and was very good.  Also tried the cajun butter just to taste it . Not really for pork or beef but would be excellent for wings.  Somewhat similar to Frank's wing sauce but with an interesting flavor twist. Brandy gave great service.

Plus, they are still coming in for half price pizzas and other drinks. His comments didn't really make sense to me and they  kind of turned me off.

The service was friendly, but there's a big BUT.  I apologized ahead of time to our server and said I cannot eat cheese, I do not like it in any form, and she was gracious and said they can cater to any dietary preferences.  She then proceeded to offer us a pizza appetizer, with cheese, and my dear husband said, ""we would, if you can leave the cheese off of part of it.""  She had forgotten the 5 minute conversation we JUST had about no cheese.  We all had the minestrone soup, which was fine, nothing special, just like the dry bread.  The meals came out, my husband and friend had the lasagna special, which they had only 1 of left (at 7:00 pm, mind you), so my husband had the seafood lasagna.  I tasted my dish, and I was certain there was cheese in it, as it tasted like dirty socks dipped in molded grass, spaghetti with meatsauce, sub the meatballs with cheese, for sausage.  I had my husband taste it, and I took a few more bites, before he insisted I send it back.  I'm not a send-it-back kinda gal, but our server confirmed that the meat sauce had cheese in it.  Really?  Again, after our 5 minute discussion on dietary preferences at the beginning of the meal?  I asked if she could do marinara, if it had no cheese, and I was gracious the whole time, but this is a HUGE misstep.  I am slightly lactose-intolerant, and could definitely feel later on that I had ingested cheese.  The fact that she had no clue or inclination to ask about this is a problem for me.  And the food itself, when it did arrive without cheese was so pedestrian that I could barely eat it.  She noted that the bill said 2 of my entree, but she took 1 off, she should have comp'd my meal, especially since my dining partners let theirs become cold while waiting for my remake.  

We won't return here.  There are several other wonderful Italian places in town that will serve me food without cheese, and take extra care to make sure I know what's in my food.

Out of the three sushi my favorite is the Mr. Shiro. This is a must try especially if you like eel. Very nice crunch and texture to it that brings a little heat as well.

The Lost Rainbow was alright. The fish was fresh and flavors were alright. Everything seems to blend in and get lost so it was slightly ""too much"" in my opinion. The flavors didn't clash, but also didn't truly compliment. Sounds amazing, but tasted average.

Lastly, the Rolling Fire. I was pretty disappointed in this one. It packed some heat, but everything was lost. The shrimp tempura inside the sushi was disappointing; it was overdone and no crisp I was to it at all. Scallops were nonexistent and if they were, the scallops were chopped enough to where they basically didn't exist.

I was shocked that we were next on the list because the place was pretty bustling, and it was Sunday at noon.  We only waited about ten minutes to be seated.

I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy dish, being on a B&G kick lately (not sure why!)  BF had the Breakfast burrito.  His mom had the challah french toast and a side of bacon, and his dad the eggs benedict.  The portions were huge and great for the price!  Service was quick and food was pretty good.

I didn't care for the sausage in the gravy.  It was not the crumbly breakfast sausage I am used to in breakfast gravy, instead it was sliced and spicy.  The biscuit was a little dry.  I much prefer the b&g at Green Eggs Cafe, but I would try another dish at North Third when we go back.  BF had the same review for his burrito.. was tasty but Green Eggs does a better job all around.  The french toast came with 3 HUGE slices.  His mom ended up sharing with all of us.  We thought the side of bacon was only $1 due to weird spacing on the menu, but it was really $4.  (add $1 for bacon only applies to the omelet).

The decor was a little strange... a taxidermied boar with the head on one wall and the tail on the wall behind it?  Spiders and skulls and other assorted halloweeny decorations?  All of them, and the walls, covered in a thick cake of dust?  They definitely need some work on cleaning up the dining room.

It was pretty good, I wish the bread was thinner and more grilled -more panini like. This one was more like thick white bread, which thus negated the tasty meat/egg/cheese inside.

Update: Oh wow. No. I haven't visited Urban Cantina in a few months and my how it has changed! First- the service. It's horrible. But that's probably because all the servers there were bored looking high school girls. They had time to chat it up at the bar area and clean tables while no one bothered to even take our drink order and then had the nerve to get an attitude (remember: teenage girls) when we asked for our waitress because we were ready to order. First problem. Second, the queso dip was closer to cold than it was to hot. I can't even call it lukewarm. Third- I ordered the enchiladas and... I'm not exaggerating here... the enchilada sauce must have been straight out of a McCormick's packet and just mixed with water. Literally the most bland enchiladas I've ever tasted- soupy, unseasoned, tomato water, basically. Same goes with the rice and beans- not even salted, as if that requires any effort or culinary expertise. As my husband and I like to say: ""This place has been banished"".

They allowed smoking inside witch I think is okay as long as they are not smoking on top of me other wise it does not bother me at all because I am so busy playing with all the machines and playing Texas Holdem at the tables.

My rating is based on how expensive the place is as and how expensive beer and other alcoholic beverages even though we are in a 'Indian reservation"" and it suppost to be tax free well make it cheaper so people drink here.

I preffer going near by to a bar and then coming here drunk then buying anything at all here even the food is over priced so for that and that it is hard to get around this place and employees are confused when you ask them for direction, I think giving this business three stars.

OK chocolate is still chocolate, but I went to this place to eat CHOCOLATE.  There's this whole mythology about chocolate, and this man who apparently thinks he is a real-life Willy Wonka (or, more likely, has found that having a restaurant dedicated to a man who thinks he is Willy Wonka is a good marketing scheme), so I expected better than OK chocolate.  I expected great chocolate, or at least really good chocolate.  Nope.  Like I said, it was easily outshined by the toffee dip.  Not a good sign.

In addition to fruit, there were marshmallows, pieces of chocolate-chip cookie and brownies as part of the fondue.  You can't screw up marshmallows, especially when you just buy pre-made ones like this place does, although made on-site would have been a little more special at a place known for sweet treats.

I picked Brasserie by Niche for my husband's birthday dinner this year, mostly because we have been to Niche and he really enjoyed it. We'd been wanting to try this place, too, for a while.

I opted to order from the menu, while my husband chose the fixed price menu option. The entree was a skate...a double-sided skate or something like that.

We have had skate many times and we've always enjoyed it. This skate was very very different. It had cartiledge in it still so you had to scape it from the cartiledge to eat it.

Our waiter 1. did not tell us this before ordering 2. did not explain how to eat it once the fish was served. Another waiter did tell my husband to ""scrape it"" but we didn't really know what that meant. 

In the end, the fish was just a sloppy mess and I think my husband got like three bites. That was it.

He was pissed. This was the first time I've ever seen him react like that to a meal in his life. I wanted to send the fish back, but he refused. The management overheard us bickering and asked if everything was okay. My husband didn't want to complain, so we didn't say anything.

But at the end of the meal, the waiter came over and said he'd taken the skate off of the check. Clearly they could tell we were unhappy even though we didn't say anything to them directly. That was nice, but I still wish the birthday dinner hadn't been tainted by that skate.

The rest of the food was very good and we will most likely give Brasserie by Niche another shot.",2010-05-11 16:08:06

With a day care center on the first floor, the screaming-kids-running-all-over-the-store ratio is pretty low. The food upstairs is pretty good (I recommend the mac 'n cheese). I wish there were more salespeople, since all of them seem to be occupied all of the time, and finding things in the Marketplace can be difficult. They also close kind of early (7 on Sundays) - all of the other stores in the shopping plaza are open until 9, so it seems weird that IKEA isn't open until then, too. By the registers, there is a section where you can buy returns or exchanges for real cheap - I'm not saying I'd buy a couch there or anything, but you could find glasses or plates for next to nothing. The return/exchanges policy is pretty strict, so make sure you're positive about what you're buying.",2008-02-26 18:25:33

I had dinner here with a friend and there were 5-6 other tables with diners. The 2 servers were 'sharing the load' on a Saturday night. Overall, the service was horrible. It took a while to even be attended to or for any return visits. We waited about an hour for any food and never even received the Naan that was supposed to come before the meal. They indicated that the kitchen was short-staffed. We finally get our apps and 1 of the 2 was not what we ordered (and happened to include beef when my dining partner is vegetarian). We said nothing since we thought it better to cut our losses at that point. We were then delivered a 'complimentary' app with the chef's regrets for the wait (it happened to be the one that we had actually ordered originally). We soon got our entrees (about 90 minutes after arriving). 

Both servers were young and clearly inexperienced. But also highly inattentive with no sense of urgency. While they apologized here and there, they did not seem to notice much of what was going on. We heard the male telling another table sorry that he is 'so spacey tonight for some reason.' I have a feeling that is every night.

Of the 5 dishes we had, 3 were wonderful and the other 2 were just okay. From other reviews, it sounds like the owners are good people. But if they want this restaurant to have any chance of surviving then they need to run a better operation, be present more, and get rid of staff members who will make people like myself not return, despite the good food items.",2014-08-31 15:45:29

Later, I noticed one was the bartender and the other was the bar back. So my food was ready but I asked for some extra sauce, so when the expo brought it out, the bartender was busy and TWO MEN that worked there, just stood next to my bag as I stood in front of them! What?! The bar back man told me ""it's not my job to give it to you."" ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS? You're right in front of me, bag next to you, and you can't hand it to me?! I had to walk over to my bag because their lazy asses couldn't just pick it up and hand it to me! And let me go back to before I ordered; there were people at the bar leaving, fine, but I was at the bar waiting 15 minutes for the bartender to take my order while the bar back kept looking at me, knowing I was ready to order. Annoyed, I wanted to leave but I was craving their food. 

Aside from this terrible service I had today, (3/14/16), they're food is delicious. I've come for their happy hour and come back for their not so happy hour. Sangrias are great, service is usually on point, I love their empanadas and quesadillas. I've had their tacos once, got the fish taco, and it was okay. I want to try others. Guacamole is really good, not too much of salt or cilantro or lime.

Titans 11 minute delay caused another 20 minute delay after we got there.  Was slightly peeved at that as if they had allowed seating we would have been there by the time the waiter got there, but I understand why they think it's a good business idea to do that (they're wrong, but you can't convince restaurants that very easily without more proof than is available).

Anyway, I had the mushroom omelet, a half order of their french toast, some coffee and a slice of their bread from another person who was there.

The omelet was good, the french toast I was not too fond of - I think I make a better french toast than they did, and it was $4.50 for a half order, which was 2 slices of it.  The coffee was pretty nice.  The slice of bread I had was not good.

Total time spent there was about 1.5 hours, there were lines constantly, took a bit to get our checks, about as long to process them.  Basically I think we held our seats for nearly an hour out of that waiting on something.

The waitstaff was really nice, seemed to be on top of it for the most part, except that ""it"" was getting too much to handle as crowds of people were just waiting around, getting in the way, while waiting to be seated. 

I don't think I would have liked to be at the tables up top, as those people were getting bumped in to by the people waiting to be seated who had to keep moving constantly.  At one point during our wait I just walked outside as there was no where to sit to wait, and standing meant you were always in someone's way.

Bathrooms were clean as all getout.  They have a sign up in them that tells all the awards they won, but no mention of who gave them the award, nor the year, so you'll notice right off the bat they won first and second place for best restaurant.  Mmmm hmm..

It was pretty good mind you, but I am not one for waiting, or for overpaying for mediocre french toast. (2 slices at 4.50 came out to roughly 50 cents a bite)

Trying to get out I was faced with being blocked in by someone who wanted my parking spot and could not back up due to another person behind them.  Waited about 4 minutes for them to move and try and parallel park, which blocked the person behind them behind me.  So yeah, parking is not so good - I would park on the street if possible.",2010-10-03 19:41:59

I wanted to eat both orders, but I exercised some self control (plus my SO didn't let me touch any of his).  The banana and ice cream all melted in my mouth with the help of sugar and butter that were poured on top.  

I also tried the BBQ Shrimp Pot Stickers $7 from the bar snack menu and they were very good.  I almost licked the bowl clean, but I used a spoon since this is a classy place. I wanted to stay for dinner, but there simply wasn't enough hours in a day.  Service was great and so was the ambiance.

The only thing that missed the mark was the Nashville chix sandwich. When I saw my friend order it awhile back it looked delicious so I was tempted to get it again.

I think I'd pass on it. I might give it one more shot because I usually love fried chicken. I'd give that sandwich 2 stars but everything else was fantastic

I ate in once a few years ago but don't remember much about that particular experience. Ever since then, we basically just get take out pizza for an easy dinner night.

Last night (Halloween), we called in around 5:00 to get an order for 2 pizzas and were told to come pick it up in 45 minutes. We arrived at that time and it still wasn't ready, so we left and waited for them to call when it was finally done. A whopping *2 hours* pass before our food is finally ready. Thank goodness we ordered early or we would have been some hungry bears. I know it was a busy night for them, but taking 2 hours to cook 2 pizzas is a bit extreme.

I will say their pizza is fabulous though, one of my favorites around. Nice and thin crust and whatever is in the sauce smells and tastes fabulous. It's a bit heavy on the grease (probably why it's so dang tasty), so for those trying to cut back be sure to blot the pizza with napkins before digging in.

The cocktail menu is unique and the food, particularly the pizzas, are creative. The menu is constantly changing, which is kind of stressful if you're like me and you develop loyalty to a particular drink or dish.

It's also really clean for a diner, which is shocking considering the scummy reputation most diners have.

In the end, not bad, but if you are craving Mexican food check out Cantina Dos Segundos or Taqueria La Veracruzana.

Well only if I'm already drunk and someone is throwing a VIP party  with bottle service where I can sit on those comfy white beds on the deck area- but being a good friend I would probably try to dissuade them from even picking this crappy place. Seriously, worse place to ever try to have fun on a Friday or Saturday night. I've been here twice. You quickly get in from the outside but that's just a gimmick to get you to stay. Once you're in, you have to buy a drink in order to get upstairs to the main dance-floor. The drinks are way overpriced and the mixed drinks are definitely watered down. If you do for some crazy reason decide to go here, I would suggest going for beer or wine, since they don't usually water those down.  Barely anyone, but the drunk chicks with skirts who want to hop on the lone stripper pole in the middle of the floor, are willing to stay downstairs. Why? Because the music sucks. About 90% of the people on the downstairs bar area are waiting in line with a drink to get upstairs. Also, I'd love not to have to wait in line and continually be flashed by drunk girls whose skirts are too short/loose. 

But don't expect to get upstairs anytime soon. I've waited over 20 minutes in line both times to get upstairs. The first time I got up there the music was great but it was so crowded you couldn't even make it to the bar for a much needed refill, not that I wanted to give them anymore of my money... The second time I finally made it upstairs the music was as bad as the bottom of the crate techno music they had on downstairs and no one was on the dance-floor because three guys usurped it to do some spastic Elaine Benes type dancing and scared away anyone bold enough to join them. The only good thing about this second visit was the outside deck area that is open during warm weather. It's fantastic and has a charming view of the Philly skyline. 

If you're willing to brave a 20+ minute line wait for over the top expensive and weak mixed drinks (I advise you to stick with a beer- they can't water that down right?!), drunk girls who have no business on a stripper pole, and crappy music...the deck is really nice.

I was really surprised based on the not so good reviews on here that the food was as good as it was.
Our table had the Montreal Poutine and the reuben-esqe egg rolls.
I love both- but I was really surprised by the egg rolls. This was something some one else at the table ordered and I would not have on my own. They were really delicious though and became my favorite.
The crab soup was really good. I wish I got a bowl, or two.
For my meal I had a burger cooked rare (and it actually came out pretty darn pink!!! Thanks!!! So hard to get a burger actually cooked on the rare side. This scored big points with me) The burger was juicy, and I enjoyed it. Again surprised because I read not so good reviews on here. Fries that came with it were solid too. Although I enjoyed the Poutine more.
I also had a Bloody Mary- it was just okay. I've had better. I did enjoy it though- but I do have to say it didn't taste like it had much alcohol in it, if any. I wanted a bloody mary and it fit the bill. What else can I say?
The only complaint- and not really a complaint but worth noting was the service was very slow. In our situation this was fine because it gave the table time to just chill and talk- but still. Very slow service. Our waitress was good. She was nice and checked on us several times. The trouble was in how long it took the food to come out- which I'm sure is not her fault. So, if you are someone in a rush or just hates slow service keep this in mind.

Still, not even very friendly server and guacamole maker could balance out the deficits.  And this we say to Happy Hour goers; beware of their ""two for one"" policy for libations.  

It is partly that policy, which we laughed about at first ""surprise"" but then thought not so funny, partly garish decor and partly dated menu at high prices that leaves us feeling lukewarm.  We wouldn't refuse to come back here if someone suggested it.  Neither would we suggest this as destination.

VIBE
""We would have thought this cool when we lived in the East Bay in the 1980's."", my husband said as we settled in at one of the step up booth tables in the dimly lit bar.  ""Yes"",  I said.  ""But that Medusa meets Lochness Monster sculpture evokes the bar from the first Star Wars movie.""

Not that that is a bad thing.  But it is this thing.  If this was 30 years ago, we would have ""dug it"".  Different strokes in different times.  It seems laughably garish today.

HAPPY HOUR UNHAPPY SURPRISE
We arrived about ten minutes to six.  Our plan was to have a cocktail, peruse the dinner menu and decide if we wanted to stay for dinner.  Yeeps whose opinions  I respect had given this just 2 or 3 star ratings so we figured we'd approach with caution.

Our friendly server told us there was a Happy Hour deal that ended at six o'clock.  Two cocktails or glasses of wine for the price of one, she said.  Any wine or cocktail priced $15 or less qualified and both beverages had to be the same kind, she said.  

Sounded like a pretty good deal to us.

The server handed us an IPad to review  specialty cocktail menu and wine lists.  She said she would come back to take our order as the IPad was not for ordering just for reading the menu.  Seemed redundant to us since cocktail menus and wine list were on the table.   

This is indicative of the ""flash without function"" that seems hallmark for the space.  ""Oooh, Myrtle, look at this!  An Ipad."" 

More goofiness masquerading as coolness that makes this place laughable. 

We settled on top shelf Margaritas.  The drinks arrived in a tall glass with lots of ice and mixer and a straw.  Not the worst we've ever had.  Not the best.  Still, at $10 each on the menu and in the ""two for one"" Happy Hour mode, we were feeling good about the bargain price of $5 a drink.  

But to our unhappy surprise, after nearly an hour had passed and we were nearing the bottom of our libations and getting ready to depart  our server arrived with two more drinks.  

Speechless for a moment (not often a state for me) I asked ""Umm?  We didn't order these"".  

Our nice server said THIS was the ""two for one"" at Happy Hour.  You order one and you get a second one free after you drink the first one. 

Our first response was to laugh at being ""had"".  But being long past wanting to or being able to have two cocktails and navigate, this was lost on me as ""value"".  It seems a pretty sophomoric policy of the bar to over serve two drinks to folks who only want one.  Just sayin'.  

Our server said we weren't the first customers to feel ""had"" by the policy.  Seems to me ownership is shady to promote like this.  But it fit things being kind of ""off"" here all around.

EATS
Looking over the big, two sided, laminated dinner menu we decided we'd pass (hot rock cooked steak, bbq chicken pasta...dated), order the table-side guacamole in the bar with our drink and move on.

The schtick of table-side guac seems a relic of 2000's.  Like flaming cherries jubilee table-side was for  the 1970's.  But Barbacoa sells a lot of guacamole this way.  As many as three guys with guac carts work on busy nights making up to 40 orders each we learned.  Shtick sells. (PS - There is a tip jar on the cart to tip the maker.)  Whether made table-side or in the kitchen doesn't matter as long as the guacamole is good.  And this, made and served in a molecajete, was good.  

THIS N THAT:

1) PARKING:  Private lot and it was pretty full.  Goes to show, I guess, we are in the minority opinion about Barbacoa's mediocrity.

2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Troublesome.  My Yelp friends who use wheelchairs will understand how dangerous it is to have wheelchair users have to travel behind parked cars against traffic in a parking lot  because the building owners violate the 24 year old Federal Civil Rights law and Idaho Code to put curb cuts at ADA parking locations  Also only one table at standard height in bar.  All other seating requires step up.  Dining room is step down on one side but ramp in on another.

3) NEIGHBORS:  Boise Park owned lake and walking path right behind Barbacoa.  Fast food restaurant to front.",2014-03-06 16:33:57

After 3 years of hype from friends at school, I was so excited to finally have the opportunity to try it out.  I unfortunately must say that I cannot recommend it to my fellow Yelp community.

It is TAPAS style dining (small plates), which means our table could go HAM with ordering tons of things. Thus, we really did get a flavor for the food quality and restaurant's take on Spanish fare.

+FIGS: not bad. 2 of the girls at my table (out of 4) thought it was weird though.
+CHICKEN BBROCHETAS: weird dipping sauce and generally a weird tasting flavor. not a fan.
+GREEN BEANS: tasted rather simple and kind of too plain.
+PATATAS RIOJANAS: yummy, but again really simple. nothing much to it besides potatoes.
+BRUSSELS SPROUTS: probably my favorite of the night, but again nothing special. brussels sprouts have become every restaurant's favorite thing to serve, and i've had my fair share of amazingly cooked/seasoned ones!
+BOMBA RICE: super duper weird color and weird texture. couldn't wrap my mind around it.

So you can tell I didn't particularly enjoy the food. Our waitress was also extremely awkward and shy and could not help us out with choosing dishes for the table.

The massive place is divided into different sections to suit different tastes. From more of a upscale, lounge type atmosphere at 1100 Social to a riding mechanical bull at PBR, you'll find your groove somewhere here. I personally like the Victory beer garden and outdoor stage the best! Heat lamps, fire pits, it's just chill. There are tv screens everywhere, even outside so you won't miss a second of any game. 

Sure the floors are super sticky all of the time and the restrooms aren't the cleanest on busy nights, but do you remember when there was nothing here?! I think it really adds something to the stadium filled section down in South Philly.

The service was really great and our server/the bartender was super attentive and friendly. 

Today for brunch I had somewhat of an opposite experience. They were busy, noon-ish on a Sunday, but we grabbed seats at the bar.

I asked for a new order and magically that arrived within 5 minutes. I'd ordered the Garden Benedict; basically avocado toast with poached eggs and hollandaise on top. The flavors were really good, eggs prepared perfectly and the lemon in the avocado cut the fat in the hollandaise sauce. Toast was burnt.

We'd heard a lot about Sup but had not yet had a chance to plan a visit, so you can guess how happy we were when we saw the lights on late one night one night while driving past it on our way out of town. They were still open! We quickly pulled over in front of the restaurant (I bet parking here in the day is a problem) and ran in. They were very close to locking up, but the staff was as friendly as if they'd just opened for the day and we weren't inconveniencing them at all (even tho I have no doubt we probably were, it was pretty late.)  After quickly taking our order and serving us our food promptly, they then leisurely kept checking in on us with a smile; they never once made us feel rushed; in fact, they made us feel very welcome as they encouraged us to take as long as we'd like while they puttered around cleaning up for the day. (We did hurry, though, out of consideration for their kindness in serving us last minute.)

Since we were not very hungry (we had not planned on stopping here, their being open caught us off guard), we just ordered one basic sandwich, one bowl of soup, and, as they have a great little beer selection, one Alaskan Amber. 

For the sammy, we chose a simple grilled cheese, but, at the waiter's kind suggestion, we kicked it up a notch by adding some avocado and prosciutto (you can also add turkey - all 3 can be added for just $2, what a killer option!)  It was a taste sensation. We could not get over how incredible this little sandwich was! 

They still had some chicken tortilla soup left and I'm so glad they did,  it was outstanding. Even though we enjoyed the last bowl of the day, the flavors were as fresh as if it had just been made, and we were thrilled at how deeply rich and incredibly satisfying it was. 

They kindly split our little Sup for us into two portions without being asked (even though that meant more dishes to wash right before going home, I'm sure!) and they added a divine little salad to BOTH plates at no charge. It had dried cranberries, gorgonzola  crumbles and almonds served over mixed greens with white balsamic vinaigrette. Oh man was it good. 

And for desert, we nibbled at the two adorable little cookies that came with our meal, free of charge. They were so good we bought a large version to go on the way out. 

You must stop in and dine at Sup. You'll find fresh ingredients artfully complied into tasty soups and sandwiches, all served with a friendly, bright smile... yes, even right before closing.

The sangria is amazing... whether you get the red, white or sparkling you will enjoy it. I also go with the red and trust me if you are with a larger group of friends the pitcher, although pricy ($50), is the way to go, I would say you could get 6-7 glasses out of it. 

This place is all small plates so typically when I go with my friends we each pick 3-4 dishes and share. I think the key to this place is trying new/different items to figure out what you really like. After a few times you figure out your go-to dishes. The bread and herb/olive oil dip is amazing, I think I have eaten like 3 loafs in one sitting (attractive I know). 

The atmosphere at Ceviche is really special. The inside is so warm and inviting and wait staff is helpful and extremely friendly and professional. 

Some of my favorite dishes that you can't go wrong with:

Tortilla Espainola-best thing on the menu.... This is a sort of potato/onion omelet served with a yummy pinkish sauce... I would eat this every day

Albongias- delicious and flavorful meatballs in a tomato red sauce

Solomillo A La Parilla- Beef tenderloin with mushrooms in a cream sauce

Queso De Cabra- Baked goat cheese with a tomato/basil sauce.... Need I say more?

Portobello Relleno - Portobello mushroom stuffed with spinach cheese with a sherry sauce

**please note..... the bread is a prefect use to soak up every sauce on the menu (this is probably how I got through 3 loafs)",2012-11-26 04:09:57

Thats right, this is a BP gas station that has a food counter. Street food of the  Indian, Mexican, and Greek cusines are available.      

I got a gyro platter that came with fries.   It tasted good but sat in my stomach like a brick for several hours afterwards.   Maybe a little heavy.
But the Indian food looked as good as I see at most sit down buffet places.    I think that's the stuff to go with.   I'll try that next time.

It's great being able to sample a little of everything.

The skirt steak is my favorite and is absolutely amazing. There aren't any signs or descriptions on the salad bar, so you kind of just have to grab what looks good to you. That's part of the downside to the restaurant - there is little guidance on how to operate the place from the staff.

From the outside, the place looks decent, and there was a delicious smell of food cooking coming from somewhere, so we decided to give Russo's a try.
Walked into a nearly empty restaurant (1 table had customers sitting there), and a guy standing behind the bar on the phone. I looked around to see if we should seat ourselves, or wait to be seated. The guy behind the bar yelled ""pick up or dine in?""
I said ""we'll be eating here""
He mumbled something that I couldn't understand, so we just grabbed a booth.
The guy that works there seemed to be a little scatterbrained and in a huge hurry with everything he did, even though the place was practically empty. Our menus were tossed at the table, and most interactions with him were as he walked quickly past our table. He'd ask a question, and keep going so I'd have to turn and yell my answer because he was 2 tables past me by the time I answered.
Bread came out with 2 bread plates for me and my wife. One of the plates was dirty.
Food was OK. I had Chicken Parmesan. The chicken was very thin, and I could not taste the cheese that was melted on top of it. The chicken itself was good. The spaghetti it came with though was an embarrassment to a place that calls itself an Italian restaurant. Another reviewer described the sauce as tasting like ketchup with some crushed tomatoes thrown in. I concur. It was pretty boring and bland.
We didn't finish our meals and asked for a take-out box to bring the leftovers home. The guy brought out a plastic take-out tray and a dirty lid. The lid looked like it had tomato sauce splattered on it and then it had dried out to a nice crust. Pretty gross. I asked for a clean lid, and the guy disappeared for way longer that it should have taken him to grab a new lid, but we finally got one.
When it came time to pay, my credit card was snatched out of my hand as the server/bartender/busboy/whatever he does sped by my table, still in a hurry, even though it was just us and one other couple in the restaurant.
Finally... we were there on a rainy day, and the place leaks. There was water dripping on the table in the booth next to ours, and I noticed water dripping in the entry way.

We were seated quickly and the design was really nice but after that, it was only okay. Our waiter did not intro his name, my friend likes to know or I wouldn't have noticed, and needed to speak up; This place is pretty loud at night.

We started off at 2 appetizers: Baked Mac and Cheese & Crispy Calamari. Both was pretty good. The mac and cheese was very cheese and pretty thick so that goods or bad depending on preference.

Our main courses included: Market Salad, Thanksgiving Dinner, Pecan Crusted Tilapia and Meatloaf.

For the Market Salad, you order this by clicking off what you want in it on a sheet of paper the waiter gives you in the beginning. My friend was not happy with the lacking amount of avocado they gave her.

I had the meatloaf which was okay. I am not a huge fan of meatloaf so I am not sure what meatloaf is suppose to really taste like; My boyfriend is usually the judge of that. The mash potato that it came with was alright though.

And I didn't try the Thanksgiving dinner or tilapia so I cannot say how they were; They were both finished though so that has to mean something.

Our water was always refilled which was nice and they brought us a basket of bread. Random timing since it was after our appetizers came out but bread is bread. Wish someone would have buttered them for me though! (Mean girls reference for those who don't get it.)

For a party of 2, we were told about 1 hr and 15 mins. We were lucky a spot had just opened up at the bar so we snagged that instead of waiting for a table.
Bar service was average, they were definitely busy but it didn't seem to hinder service. Drinks never went empty and everything we ordered arrived in reasonable time. Bartenders were friendly.
For our meal the wife and I both ordered the Depot Burger which has pastrami, sauerkraut, sauce and comes with a side of fries. The wife asked if they could do  lettuce instead of a bun, they don't do that here. Burgers were cooked as we ordered, medium, for once someone got this right! The pastrami was a bit disappointing, it had very little flavor and was cut thick which made it hard to get a bite of it without pulling the whole slice out. The fries were over salted, I had to constantly scrape salt off of each one before eating it. The burger had good flavor so it was sad the rest of it fell flat.
I like what they did with the décor. White subway tiles, exposed brick on the exterior walls, they even left the vault door in the mens restroom, too cool. The bar top is a bit disappointing, for how cool the rest of the place is. A tongue and groove wood bar top just felt cheap. 
Parking is difficult, numerous people were coming out the wrong way while we were trying to pull in despite the signage and arrows on the pavement. Just chalk that up to people not paying attention behind the wheel, common around here.
My main issue with this place is the pricing. A classic burger is $14. The pastrami burger was $15. Beer was also pricey, $10 for a blonde barleywine, $7 saison, stout $6. A guy next to me ordered 2 cocktails and his total was $26. They sell growlers too, $65 for the big one, $45 for the small. I guess they are trying to recoup their investment in a hurry!

My friends, fortunately, were able to book a last-minute brunch at Butcher Bar. The atmosphere was exciting, a chic bi-level eatery accented by Southern homeyness. Immediately walking in is a long bar, stocked with plenty of drink options. We were brought through dining areas, decorated with vintage posters and butchershop decor, taking the stairs down into a backyard patio. The patio had a hydraulic awning and heat lamps to make sure its comfortable even for the winter. 

We were surprised, however, when they brought us to a table for 6 when our reservation was for 8. The host sheepishly proceeded to place 2 extra chairs on either end of the table, but it felt too cramped. Afterward, no one greeted us at our table for nearly 15 minutes. When we finally managed to get our waitress's attention, she was unprofessional and rude toward us. Her attitude lasted throughout the remainder of the meal, and it seemed as though she made every effort to ignore us from then on. We even ended up having to ask the manager for water.

Although the service was abysmal, the food was actually quite good! One of my friends and I decided to split two dishes: the Fried Chicken & Waffle Benedict and the Royale with Cheese. The chicken was separate from the waffle benedict on the plate, which ensured that it stayed crispy. My only critique was that the waffle was soggy, but that's what happens when it's left to sit underneath the egg and hollandaise. Meanwhile, the burger was really good. The bun was firm and buttery, while the burger was juicy and flavorful (but perhaps a bit overcooked for my taste). The fries were well-seasoned and served with a delicious BBQ sauce, but I wish they were just a bit crispier.

Next came out the Roasted Cauliflower with Capers and onion and....oh wow....this thing, is a MUST get.  It was so good....I only wish they laid off the salt a bit.  The capers already were mega salty, that no added salt was needed.  My mouth was on fire from the salt afterwards.

First of all, I didn't see any signs of pricing (I checked on my way out, still didn't see it). I asked and found weekday lunch was $8.05 +tax per person.  I didn't try the teppan nor the salad bar.  Sushi selections seems big, but if you look closely, they are pretty much with immitation crab meat stick or immitation crab salad, just wrapped in different ways.  Tasted ok, just ok.

Quite some soup selections.  Hot and sour soup was pretty good.  Enough desserts to choose from, don't taste too bad.: Cakes, cookies, pudding, sugar coated peanuts, and ice cream 

The Chinese dishes were way too salty and greasy.  A lot of the meat dishes (especially the chicken) were dry. I couldn't handle more than 2 bites.  Dim sum was not bad.  However the pork bun was out for the entire time I was there.  Never refilled.  The custard buns were pretty good, but those are ordered from a supplier, and many other Chinese buffet ordered from the same company (I can tell from the wrapping).  I have to give them some credits for streaming them right.  I have been to other Chinese buffet where they didn't even steam them right and were hard.  The egg tarts from the dim sum section was not really Hong Kong style.  It was baked in wonton wrap and the filling was mayo, sugar and some eggs.  Pretty greasy and nasty, it was like eating a spoonful of warm mayo mixed with sugar.

I was surprised to see them offerring chicken feet there.  Because other dishes were so salty, when I got into the feet, they tasted pretty plain.  If I tried them first, they might taste great.

In my honest opinion, I think for the quality of food, $8.05 is about $1 or $2 over priced for lunch.  Good varieties of dish selections which don't taste descent enough for inexpensive Chinese buffet.  However, I may go back just for the chicken feet.

I still have not figured out how much they charge for weekday dinner.",2017-03-14 03:30:45

Some relatives from Cali came in to visit so we stopped here after picking them up for the airport. 

We arrived there at a time that most restaurants aren't that busy; smack dab between lunch and dinner. However it was still an hour wait here, and I'm actually shocked it was *only* an hour given how many people were there. 

I really liked the building(s) itself. For anyone who doesn't know, the Loveless Cafe and surrounding shops are a converted motel from the 50's. I love places like this; you can tell just by looking at it that it's a relic from the golden age of highway road trips. You almost never see such things anymore, as they've either been torn down or are in complete disrepair because they went out of business after the interstate system was built. 

The little shops were cool. Touristy but charming. They had quite a few interesting items, as well as some food such as jams and cured meats. I had plenty of time to check them out while waiting on my table.

Once we were finally seated, I was quite impressed by the service. Despite being packed to capacity, our server was extremely attentive and very sweet, taking plenty of time to explain the specials and whatnot. I ordered their blue plate special for the day, ""Honeyspice"" chicken or something to that effect. It was a half chicken barbecued with a spicy honey-based sauce. It was absolutely fantastic, as were the turnip greens and okra that accompanied it. The biscuits, for which this place is apparently known, were quite good as well. My girlfriend and I shared a slice of fudge pie for dessert and it was quite delicious. 

All in all it was a really fun experience, but the wait is long enough that this isn't the sort of place I'd want to go to regularly. However it seems to be a fantastic place to bring visiting family or other people who have never been, and it's definitely a place I think everyone should experience at least once.",2014-08-20 14:32:22

It's a fun atmosphere inside or out, and we were on the deck overlooking the busy marina area and saw a few dolphin periodically surfacing to check out the human activity.

Our server, David, made some good suggestions, so we kicked off with Seafood Hush Pups and the Popcorn Shrimp. Both were tasty. We then shared our entrees of Shrimper's Heaven, Bourbon Street Mahi-Mahi and Mama's Southern Fried Chicken (there's always one that orders chicken at a seafood place, hot dogs at a taco stand, potato chips at an ice cream bar, etc.!) We closed with Mama's Bread Pudding, and that was a hit.

All of the chow was good, but had a bit of the 'get it on the plate and keep it moving' taste. Not bad at all, but could be better with a little bit more attention. We'll be back for another try.

The fish in the fish tacos was nicely prepared, not too dry or anything. But the cole slaw kind of reminded me of something that your mom throws together for a BBQ, but not in a good way. The chicken taco was underwhelming. It could have been canned chicken for all I know.

When a customer (me) says in a cheerful tone, ""Wow! I wish y'all had a side salad in addition to your large salads!"", it's good to tell that customer how gosh, darn wrong they are. It's also good to tell the customer that they have no idea about their own food and nutritional needs. 

Which is how my visit to The Big Cheezy started. Faced with a menu of really high fat, high calorie offerings, I was wishing for a side salad. I can only punish my body so much. Hashtag adulting sucks. But I ordered something, and I was only sorta sick from the high fat, high calorie bomb later. 

The atmosphere is...well, it's on par with one of those nice new fast food joints. Nothing special to speak of, decor-wise. Most of the tables were dirty when we visited, and the staff didn't seem to notice. The 3 people who ran our food did seem like overkill. Okay. 

The coke machine wasn't working when we visited, and they hadn't made any other plans. I mean, I know it's not ideal, but they could have picked up some cans of coke and sold 'em instead of just being reduced to free water cups. I suspect of the owner or some sort of high up manager was around, a different choice would have been made. I saw it as an annoying loss of revenue. 

I haven't been back. Once was enough, in a loud, expensive greasy spoon that only serves grilled cheese. I'm pretty sure I can't afford to do this again, anyway.

Plus, since the Pandemic, we've been getting deliveries from here more than actually picking stuff up.

When I go to Saint Louis, I always go to Iron Barley, not because they're famous, but because they're awesome! I love Iron Barley. It's high end food without the pretentiousness. It's also the place that I take someone unfamiliar with Saint Louis to as well. So, yea, it's good!

From the outside, it looks unassuming, but the inside, it has a rustic bar charm. It's delightfully unassuming, and the decor kind of reminds me of the kitschy chain restaurants, which just adds to its charm because it most certainly is not. If you want an example of a Gastropub, this is it. Did they invent this trend?

The prime rib here is ridiculous. It's cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth like butter. No BS, butter. It's combined with a rich risotto that is the perfect accouterment to the steak. It's rich, nicely seasoned and just begs you to eat more and more. And, when risotto asks nicely, who am I to argue? But, if steak isn't your thing, they have a crazy amount of options, including a variety of specials that change periodically. They'll tell you about them, but if not, ask.

Again, ask about the drink specials. Like the food specials, the drink specials change periodically, and you may find some random deliciousness. On my last visit, I got a Bacon Bloody Mary that knocked my socks off.

As for customer service, our servers have always been incredible. They are attentive, quick, knowledgeable, and jovial.

But, parking can be a bit of a chore, and it's not in the best area. That's my only complaint, but that tends to be the case at most Saint Louis joints.

I have tried a couple other items on their menu, but I've been underwhelmed by everything else each time.

My biggest drawback to this place is that the initial greeter has often been somewhat unfriendly/abrupt, and the servers aren't particularly amiable either. They're efficient, but hey, I can't deny that I prefer to go to brunch places that are a bit more personable.

Having been here several times before to dance (drunk) upstairs, I decided it was finally time to check out the menu during non-drunken hours.  Let me tell you, I am impressed.

For an appetizer, we ordered the mac & cheese which came with a not-so-heaping scoop of pulled pork.  The mac & cheese was delicious and creamy, but the pasta was a little awkward (it was like long, thick ziti) to maneuver - don't worry, I somehow found the strength and courage to get it in my mouth.  I didn't care much for the pulled pork and thought it a tad on the sweet side, but my friend thought it was delicious.  For entrees, I got the mussels and he got the burger.  The mussels were absolutely fantastic and came in a delicious safflower broth (I have no idea what safflower is, but I liked it).  My dish also came with a large helping of fries, but I was so full from the mussels and appetizer, I didn't really eat any of them.  My friend thought the burger was pretty good, moist, and tasty.

I greeted her and said I'd like a small diet coke.  She shared with me (phone still to ear) that she the line was...""down here""....which was two feet from where I was standing.  I asked her if that meant she couldn't take my order from where I was currently standing.  She didn't have a reply, phone still to ear.  I went somewhere else for my soda, which seemed to suit her as well.",2013-01-25 18:13:09

Capitalizing on a prominent location with a heck of a view, the recently-opened Water Springs Diner & Bar has recently risen to the the challenge.

With both dining room and lounge area there is seating for at least 150; the lounge can be closed off for private events. On our evening visit the place was more than half-full, with karaoke taking place in the lounge. Signage indicates there is occasional live music as well, fairly uncommon for a family diner.

Service was friendly and prompt throughout our experience. An order of coconut shrimp got things started, served with a wedge of lemon and sweet and spicy orange marmalade sauce ($9.99). The tender shrimp were on the large side, their deep-fried coconut coating providing a nice, golden brown crunch.

Following tradition, entrees are served with a choice of soup or salad. Further following tradition, Friday clam chowder was a no-brainer; I do love a good cup of chowdah. This cup was actually a small bowl filled with plenty of thick and creamy housemade soup, sporting big chunks of potato and plenty of chopped clam. My only criticism would be that the seasoning--with a lot more salt and pepper than I normally expect for chowder--overpowered the clam flavor a bit. This nitpick didn't stop me from finishing every drop. 

My entree was cooked to order--medium rare--though possibly the thinnest cut of ribeye steak I've been served ($19.99). About half an inch by ten inches, it was still a full twelve ounces of very tender and perfectly-seasoned beef. I've paid more for worse steaks at actual steakhouses. Steamed asparagus on the side was just a tad overcooked, but a big pile of mashed potatoes was above-average. Topped with a peppered chicken gravy, several inch-sized chunks of spud made me feel right at home.

My wife's dinner salad was a simple, small pile of chopped romaine lettuce with just a touch of diced tomato and grated cheese, dressing on the side. In contrast, her lobster ravioli entree was about as rich as a dish of pasta can be ($15.99). Fresh basil cream sauce topped with plenty of grated parmesan supported a  combination of spinach, onion, and shellfish in al dente envelopes of pasta. As with my soup and gravy, a noticeable-yet-acceptable note of black pepper was present in the seasoning.

My buddy's mushroom swiss burger featured a half-pound of ground Angus chuck, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle, house sauce, and plenty of sliced, sauteed mushrooms embedded in the melted cheese. Though ordered with onion rings, the plate came instead with fries. Our server realized the error without being told and quickly returned with a side of huge, beer-battered rings to enjoy along with the crispy, salt-and-peppered fries.

Deep-fried ice cream ($5.25) and housemade flan ($4.75) were ordered and shared; both were quite good. The ice cream was still so frozen it was a bit tough to dig in a spoon. The flan was just a tad lumpy in texture, akin to smooth tapioca, with a very good caramel sauce. 

My order of apple pie was less successful ($5.25). The filling was tasty, but the crust was ruined by a run-in with microwaves. For me, a pie with top crust should always be either re-heated conventionally or served at room temperature. Microwaving turns a flaky crust into mush. I would have gladly waited a few extra minutes for a just-warmed, flaky slice of all-American indulgence.

This friendly little diner is still new and finding its way, but we all agreed it was a meal we'd repeat. With an extensive menu of breakfast, lunch, American and Mexican options, Water Springs Is working hard to become a neighborhood favorite.",2016-03-02 19:26:20

That's the best way to describe it.  Everything was FINE.  Just fine.  But when our bar tab is $60 for a few drinks, and I felt like I needed to go over the menu about 8 times to find something exciting to try (I landed on the burger), I felt let down.  

All of the reviews of this place made me want to come visit.  I think these must all be Vandy kids or tourists who don't know where the better quality places are with better prices.  

I just felt, well... so meh about the whole thing.  

Again, everything was fine, decent, even.  But by the time to pay the bill came, my husband and I thought of at LEAST 5 or 6 different places we could have gone for BETTER drinks with CHEAPER prices and a much better menu.

We were set up at a long table in the basement, Mad Hatter style.  It seemed sort of weird until everyone showed up and the space became full.  At that point, the low ceilings and dim lighting made our group of 20 feel like an intimate gathering.  We opted for Han's family style tasting menu: medium heat, not too exotic, enough vegetarian options for 5 people.  We popped open a few of our BYO bottles, and  within 15 minutes, dishes started filling the table.

My friend guinea-pigged the spice level for me, and I tried anything she promised would not burn my face off.  Some of the items still ended up being a little too spicy for my comfort level, but everything was delicious.  Even if something was a little hot, the flavors still managed to pop through and I wasn't ever left wishing I hadn't tried it.  

I would love to highlight my favorites, but when I check back on the actual menu, everything is listed by cooking style, and I'm just not sure what I ate.  There was some amazing shrimp that was passed around, as well as a great beef dish and a plate of string beans that ruined me for every other string bean I ever eat from this point forward.  But that doesn't really help you choose for future orders, does it?

At the end of the night, when the check arrived, I crossed my fingers that I took out enough cash and that I wouldn't be that annoying person who only has unbroken 20's.  I was in luck!  Amazingly, each of us only had to put in $19 for plate after plate of yummy, spicy Chinese gut-fillers, and that INCLUDED tip!  I passed one of my 20s down the table and vowed to come back to Han Dynasty ASAP.",2010-11-20 15:05:50

We were ushered to our seat and patiently waited for someone to bring us water and take our orders. My choice was the basil duck and my wife picked the drunken noodles. Our starter dish was the steamed dumplings.

It took forever for our appetizer to be served, but it was certainly worth the wait. A delicate sauce moistened the mixture of pork and shrimp filling. Winner!! We were to meet a friend who had not yet arrived, so perhaps they were waiting serving our lunch until he arrived. Eventually, our server brought our meals- my basil duck and my wife's drunken noodles.

I don't know what I expected from my basil duck, but it was certainly not a basket of flavors. None of the flavors there even attempted to outdo the rest. The duck should have been tender and easy to cut- but it wasn't. On the other hand the rice that came with my duck was moist and fluffy.

Now to rate Eastern Peak. Our server, Kayla, appeared when she thought it necessary. Our starters, the steamed dumplings, were simply the best ever.

The main reason I come here is convenience. It's in a great location, right in Chinatown. In fact, this is a great place to run out for lunch and grab a quick bite.

I usually get one of the vermicelli bowls with either spring rolls or char grilled pork. I love the fish sauce that it comes with and usually just empty the sauce into my noodles before I enjoy.

As always, we were hungry.  We both ordered the Miso Soup and it was a light and tasty start to our meal.  We then were given complimentary fried rice balls which were (on their own) bland but there was enough sauce to make them interesting.  Next up, we ordered the fried Calamari and the Duck Eggrolls.  The Calamari was lightly breaded and was quite tender however two sauces are drizzled over them.(see pic.)  I would rather have an option of the sauce covering them or not.  We had great hopes for the Duck confit eggrolls and they were flavorful but very mushy.  Cooking meats in the confit method creates a delicious flavor and texture but not for a crispy eggroll.

For our entrées, we ordered three rolls:  the Bubba Gump, Crabulous and the Maine Event.  All three were beautifully made and presented.  Of the three, the Crabulous had the most distinct flavor profile.  The Maine Event gave me no indication of the flavor or texture or anything to do with spicy lobster meat.  We were hoping for bolder flavors in all of the rolls.

Because we were still hungry, we decided to order some dessert.  Because of the pictures that we had seen here on Yelp, we both ordered the Tiramisu.  It is a delicious and creative dessert with a creme brulee top layer that was awesome.  One slight disappointment was it's presentation. We were handed the Martini glass full of the dessert and a spoon.  It was not presented well, at all.(see pic)  For the price, we were expecting a lot more.

To say that the service was rushed would be an understatement.  Our server was friendly enough but he was either wanting to remove our plates with food still on them or pressuring us to order quickly.  After spending around $100(incl. tip), we would have liked a more relaxing meal.  The ambiance is somewhat lacking in that I had a full-on kitchen view of employees washing their hands, throughout the meal.

Our waitress Monica was super friendly!! One of our favorite places to eat. They have weekly specials that are $6.95 for breakfast and lunch. The dinner also comes with fresh hot bread and a scoop of ice cream for dessert. That's a heck of a deal! Plus a monthly dessert special for $3.50.

Tonight my husband had the cod and fries with coleslaw. Yep you guessed it, it was one of the special of the week. It reminds of the blue plate specials at Woolworth's when I was a kid. Something very charming and comforting in getting specials beside being frugal and helpful on the wallet. 

I got soup, salad and bread. The soup was cream of mushroom. The soup was ok. I ate my soup and was too full to eat my salad. I got a to go container to take my salad home with me.

Everything that I've tried has been delicious! My top choices would be the fish & shrimp tacos, and the poblano pizza. 

The grilled steak sandwich was delicious and the meat was very tender and not chewy at all. This sandwich has all the ingredients that I love, such as arugula, tomatoes, grilled onions, and a red pepper aioli served on a baguette.

I love the complimentary chick peas they serve. The seasoning kinda reminds me of KFC spices. Definitely addicting and a nice treat! 

My go to drink here is Dante's inferno. They had me at coconut and strawberry shrub! This drink has a spicy kick at first from the arbol chile but not so hot that It takes away from the drink. It's slightly sweet and very refreshing. After a few sips it won't be so spicy. 

They have a great looking bar inside and a very nice outside dining area as well. Seems like dining outside is most popular here.

The curry sauce was light, with a great blend of coconut milk and spice and there were plenty of bamboo shoots & vegetables in the dish.  The dinner portion was large enough for 2 meals and came with a heaping pile of steamed white rice.

-service was great 
-plenty of local beer options 
-highlight: pretzel breadsticks served with Harvarti dill and beer cheese dips (I liked how strong the beer flavor was in the dip - borderline drinkable)
-I was a bit disappointed by the Gooey Spinach Melt with house made spinach dip with melted white cheddar, bean sprouts, & diced tomato on dark rye bread.

After entering the restaurant, my friend and I decided to go sit in the outdoor patio on the 2nd floor.  For Florida weather it was actually quite comfortable, enjoying the breeze.  I enjoyed the idea that the menu changes often, due to using fresh local ingredients.  For dinner, we started off with the ratatouille.  Which was basically grilled veggies served over biscuits.  The ratatouille tasted buttery.  It is a simple dish, probably not worth the price.  For my meal, I had the flat iron steak, with German potatoes.  The steak was tender and juicy, lots of flavor.

Naan and Kabab offers an interesting fusion of Mediterranean/middle eastern (Iranian/Persian) dishes.  The kitchen staff seem to have a consistent style of cooking, but opinions will probably vary if you're a big fan of, say, Greek cuisine - things will probably taste different than you'd expect.  We had the falafel plate and beef/lamb/etc. Koobedeh plate.  Plenty of food for two.  No drinks.  $22 w/tax.

Pluses:
- courteous and professional servers
- nice evening ambiance
- good, seemingly consistent food (though only one visit so far)
- parking, but we saw people taking spots who were headed to the Peppermill (a-holes)
- warm naan (more like pita bread than Indian naan) served promptly after ordering, meals served quickly
- meat and vegetables grilled perfectly
- Maurice made the rounds in the dining room and is a very nice guy

Minuses:
- I detected no saffron taste to saffron rice, which was too dry for my taste
- texture of falafel a little too ""doughy"" for my taste
- bench seats near door are very uncomfortable; wooden plank at shoulder height means you can't lean your back against them, so are forced to perch on the seat.  We could have moved, but had our child with us and didn't want the hassle.  Maurice: please get this fixed!!!
- bathrooms open almost directly into dining room, though are screened by the uncomfortable bench seats and a trellis of sorts (those on the bench seats may exposed you to, um, unpleasant odors, as we were)
- Maurice encouraged a neighboring table (two young women) to positively Yelp-review the place, offering them a complimentary dessert, apparently to 'sweeten' the deal.  Pretty tacky, and I guess I'm not cute enough to get offered anything for free ;)

I was the DD and the bartenders were not happy when I was ordering water for my drink - they still served me but didn't like that I wasn't paying for alcohol.

This is a great location literally steps away from Busch.  If you've never been, try to go at least once so you know what all the hype is about and you can say that you have been there.",2013-09-25 15:07:16

They were super busy and we worried that we should have made a reservation, although I did hear them say that even their reservation list was almost full. Luckily we got a seat at the bar, which wasn't the best ambiance or service wise, but I was just happy that we were able to get seating. 

The service was really great to start, but as more customers trickled into the bar, and the bartender got busier with drink orders we ended up waiting extended periods of time for things like the dessert menu and our check. Although when he did get a chance to get around to us he was super attentive to our needs and a really genuinely friendly guy, so I do give him a bit of a lass for just being busier than expected.

We weren't drinking this night so we ended up getting Italian sodas. I highly recommend this if you don't drink or are just looking for something nonalcoholic for the night. I got the caramel and it was the perfect balance of creamy, sweet, a tiny bit smoky. So delicious and refreshing. 

We started out with the clams and mussels appetizer which was a super unique flavor for this kind of dish. It had bits of chorizo and Calabrian chili's to give it a slightly smoky, spicy flavor. And the broth was so good soaked into the crusty bread. 

For dinner, we got two of the specials. The sea bass with crispy polenta, eggplant purée, and roasted tomatoes and fennel and the pork belly risotto. The bass was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely and once you got the ""perfect bite"" of every element of the dish it was really delicious. And the pork belly was tender and juicy with perfectly al dente risotto with a unique smoky tomato flavor. Both dishes were very delicious and generously portioned. 

I would definitely return here. But I'd probably make sure you have a reservation next time in order to accommodate the service style a little better. And I'd definitely love to try one of their many different spritz styles on my next visit.",2020-10-05 14:50:44

My girlfriend and her family live near where they can order takeout if not choosing to dining in.  Even when we moved to Virginia, we would stop by during each Christmas visit and eat there and most of the time the food was top notch from service to quality.  This visit however posed a big difference.

As like many restaurants across the country, they're doing strictly takeout due to the pandemic.  Upon entering inside the building, they have signs requiring face masks and hand sanitizer stations.  Also, the entrance to the dining area is blocked by chairs.  So, we would have to go on the right side of the bar to pick up your order.  There were a bunch of orders showing that the community was still supporting the business.  One sign on the door says 5 people can enter at a time.  When we got there, it was slightly more than 5 people, even though they were wearing masks.  And it looked like there was some confusion with one of the orders that was placed by another party where they requested for a refund (another story).  

Once we picked up our orders, we headed back to my girlfriend's childhood home.  Now remember when I said the food was top notch?  Well, not this time.  I ordered a boneless chicken combination lunch plate (all-white meat) with fried rice, veggies and an egg roll.  Unfortunately, the chicken didn't have much flavor.  The fried rice was light in texture and color, was bland and the shrimp looked like it was processed rather than shrimp you would see straight off the Gulf of Mexico.  The egg roll itself was more like a kitchen sink with veggies, meat and gravy mixed inside, which was odd.  On every visit, my meal would be so big that I would save the rest for later on in the night or the next day.  But I ended up throwing it all away :(

As for China Doll, I'm sure they are struggling mightily during the pandemic.  The reason for the quality of the food is maybe the result of vendors not being able to supply the usual fare which might have them 'cutting corners' just to get food out to their usual customers.  Again, just speculation, not fact.  I just hope that once this pandemic clears up, they'll be able to function on a normal basis.  And we'll be there to support them as much as we can.",2021-01-01 05:51:29

The food menu is similar to Penca, both places offering the more sophisticated side of Mexican cuisine.  Their drinks are flamboyant, but unless you order a double, they end up tasting just a bit too sweet --  a diabetic's dream, or consequently, nightmare.  Their dishes (I've tried most of them) are unique and all merit a try, though I find an overwhelming vinegar taste to the seasoning in most all the dishes.  Twice I've left the restaurant with canker sores due to the high acidity of the dishes.  Their happy hour menu isn't a terribly wonderful bargain, but in addition, they have some happy hour days of the week, and the 1/2 price bottle of wine on Tuesday is a good complement to the other happy hour food items, such as a few small tacos or the soup.
I went last night and the service was exceptional.  I am always impressed when a wait person doesn't rush a couple eating, or try to whisk plates away when the first person gets finished eating something.  This waitperson was superb and left both our plates on the table until we were both finished.  Kudos to that!  The hostess experience wasn't quite as stellar.  As a guy, I don't get the nicest table.  I wonder why I am always feeling that the best table is for ""someone else.""  Anyhow, I asked later to be moved, and it wasn't a problem at all.
If you are looking for a dining experience, and a feeling of ""going out"" I feel Reforma, with its elegant, posh decor, and sophisticated menu, ends up feeling like a special night out.  I would ask that they temper a few of their dishes to a less vinegary seasoning, create smaller drinks that actually taste more like drinks than fruit cocktails, and improve on all aspects of the dining service, from hostessing to waitstaff, and it would be 5 stars.

I decided to order a couple of entrees: spicy seafood tom yum, thai-feast and minor sushi rolls.

Spicy seafood tom yum - quite disappointed due to the flavorings of the soup it was quite strong.It would be great if the soup had a strong but mild subtle taste.Also, in my tom yum i only found 2 mussels and 2 shrimp and a 1 piece crab legs. Less veggies, I would prefer a balanced dish. 

Thai-feast- highly recommended, but for a feast its quite small. They just need to put it in a bigger plate.

Sushi rolls - sushi rice was wet and mushy. 

Ambience was great very modern with a rustic feel.

Dining was kinda weird the seats /booth. If you have a companion with you instead of facing them when eating.You will be looking at another table across of you watching them eat.It was a bit uncomfortable, I prefer looking at my food instead of another.

Someone bought a very small house on Tchoupitoulas closed in the patio, grabbed some hostess stands & tables from  the reject piles of Robert Irvines Restaurant Impossible show, thru up a few strands of those white fat bulb Xmas lights & called it a Restaurant.  The foam board ceiling must have leaked in a few places but Duck Tape to the rescue.  The tables are set w/ that white paper, candle, small vase of pretty flowers & a wine glass.

We were sat in the patio portion of the place by a set of French doors which looked like they came from the junk pile of someone's home renovation.  Hey, I am all about that old refurbished look.

The men's restroom was outside of this door we sat by & it never shut properly so that didn't help w/ keeping our area cool.

The service was wonderful!  Very impressed that other servers picked up the dirty dishes from any table & not just their own.  Tables are so small in restaurants as it is I cannot stand when the empty dirty app. dishes are left behind when the entrees are brought.

They brought a basket of olive & corn bread w/ some butter to the table. PEOPLE!  This is the south. If you are going to do cornbread, you better do it right.  The cornbread was so bland. No sweetness @ all.  Moist but tasteless. I did not try the olive

Apps we had Fried Green Tomato which was pretty good & the Stuffed Poblano Peppers which was just ok.

Entree I had the stuffed pork tenderloin which was WONDERFUL. It was brought to me on a white plate all elegant w/ a Dollar Store steak knife. My husband had the Duck which was so tender it just fell off the bone. Had great flavors.

Let me just start off by saying I loved the ordering kiosks's because you could really get what you wanted without feeling like a hassle to a person over the counter. As someone who's never been before, it was nice to be able to flip through the menu on a screen versus stumbling over my words and reading a board that i can't really see (it was crowded I swear otherwise I would've never taken as long as I did). 

I opted for the ""make your own"" stir fry, and the system walks you through what you can add, etc. Very user friendly. 

Our food was MTO in about 10(ish) minutes and then we sat down to enjoy. They really stuffed a lot into the cute little take out boxes. I got the spicy garlic sauce, and it was amazingly good, but i probably should've opted for the normal garlic because my mouth was burning the entire time. The noodles were so flavorful and the toppings were plentiful. I'm so glad I finally came to this place, because now I know why it's such a cult favorite.

I sent my husband 20 minutes from our house to pick up dinner because our favorite bbq place was out of ribs and pork steaks. I got a chicken Caesar salad. I wasn't expecting it to already be tossed, but I'm not mad about it. Other than being a little soggy it had good flavor and still had a bit of crunch. There was one soggy crouton which I pulled out. It's like they knew I was on a low carb diet or something?! I was VERY disappointed with the amount of chicken! 6 tiny slices of chicken. Flavor again was great, but damn! That was my dinner and I feel like it was an appetizer! I'm still very hungry. My husband got the backyard burger which is listed as a stuffed burger.... looks like a normal burger patty to me... photo shared (you tell me). He said it still had good flavor and loved the bacon greens as a side. When the world opens back up we will come back and eat there and give it another shot because the food was really good.... just not exactly what we expected. So many great options on the menu, but not sure the description is as good as the actual food.

1) Rice noodles. And all the sauces are labeled as to what is and isn't gluten free. They have HUGE bottles of gf tamari out for your use. Maybe not so great if you're super sensitive or a celiac, as they do just reuse the woks one after another for stir frys.
2) You get a decent amount of stir fry for $7.50. Really, the little container they give you is the same size as what you'd get at a local chinese place. I had leftovers.
3) Local, ethically sourced ingredients!
4) The staff are super friendly
5) You order your food on a computerized POS, like wawa hoagies. I personally like that because it's all laid out in front of me. It's clear to understand, and they're very open about what's included in base price and what's extra.

Felipe's hits the spot though! That being said, there are a couple things I don't like here that I don't order. The guac here is totally average, as is the watered down pico. Aside from that, Felipe's makes some top-notch burritos. The way they melt the cheese here is a game changer. The carnitas are super flavorful and I like that their corn is warm unlike Chipotle. The best part has to be the refried beans option. 

I eat here twice a week post workout and it is great every time. If you want a solid burrito, here's my order fellow Yelpers: super burrito with cheese, corn, rice, refried black beans, *FRESH AVOCADO* (Yes, they have sliced avocado if you ask!), sour cream.

They have very nice outdoor seating with heated lamps / fires all around to create a more romantic atmosphere. They have a bar outside and inside for diverse seating

Service was very slow, understandably though since it was close to opening night with lots of people. It took 20 minutes just for 3 well drinks to come out. 

They have a happy hour at night that's 3 dollar well drinks and domestic beers and 15 dollar buckets.

Food we got to try 3 appetizers and an entree. The portions were hugeeeeeee and prices were not expensive. The Mahi pesto angel hair pasta was unfortunately over cooked. The fish was tougher than it should have been with very little seasoning. The pasta was too soft and runny but the taste was good. 

The onion rings were HUGE. They were definitely the standout thing of the night. Nice battered gigantic rings with a good sauce to pair with it. Chicken tenders were ok, not anything special at all. The toasted ravs and fried cheese were good.

I waited several days to write this review because, I was walking a tightrope between two and three and stars. If I was given the option I likely would give them 2.5 Stars. So, I only landed on three stars, I hope my review sheds light on why they were not a perfect 5. Firstly, let's start with the people the hostess was pleasant funny and congratulated us on our big day. It was a great start to walking through the door. We only waited for a few minutes and we were taken to our table where we find a congratulations card. That was a huge touch. Next, here came who I believe was the waiter assistant. He dropped off bread and there were two rolls in a cracker and  butter. We simply ask him what was in the butter and to tell us what type of breads and the cracker that we've received. He was holding another basket of bread so I'm assuming he was trying to get to another table. He said your waitress will be around shortly and he was off. So, we were left to explore the Bread Basket and it was later determined the butter was infused with a Chardonnay and we received a white roll a raisin roll and their special cracker with seasoning. The bread was okay it wasn't warm and it was quite hard so it wasn't anything to write home about but the infused butter was quite good. Next, here comes the menus and everything on the menu you order your protein and the side separately that includes starters like salads and soups. They basically had three or four cuts of me in different sizes sirloin, filet mignon, and ribeye and possibly a T-bone if I remember correctly. They eat started around $55 and go all the way up to nearly $100. We did not have sticker shock we were expecting to pay to have really great steaks. The waitress was very awkward to deal with and when you would ask her a question it would almost feel like she was treating you like a kid. I asked her a simple question which steak did she prefer. Instead of Simply answering the question and maybe telling me why she likes that steak,she decided to educate us, explaining what a ribeye is compared to the other three options. It took her it took her nearly 8 to 10 minutes to explain something we both already understood. It wasn't that she took the time to explain it it was the way she explained it as if she was explaining state to a third grade class. She decided to also explain temperatures. I digress. So, we both decided on the filet mignon I ordered my steak medium rare and my husband ordered his steak medium well. My steak was perfectly cooked. However, my husband steak was basically exactly like mine. So, my fiance does not like medium rare and so I asked if there was any type of sauce he could dip it in. She basically about fell off the side of her horse. She said I guess I could bring you a peppercorn sauce. We apparently committed the ultimate sin by asking for something that dip is undercooked steak in. We initially asked if she could cook it a little longer. She said that once it was served at cannot go back on the grill. The peppercorn sauce that she brought was like a cooking agent it was really it was not a dipping sauce. I enjoyed my steak however it did lack flavor. This really did affect our night. We also started with a salad and a french onion which both were very enjoyable and we added a side of macaroni and cheese which also was very good. So, the sides were fantastic and the meat was not cooked properly and lacked flavor. We have eaten at Michelin star steak houses around the world and just all-around great steakhouses we understand a good steak. The waiters Behavior made us wanting to get out of there as quick as possible. We ended up spending nearly $200 and left feeling very disappointed. The ironic portion of this was we were intending to go back 3 days later to have dinner with her family and decided to go elsewhere. I wish this review was different and we would have really enjoyed our wedding dinner. We just didn't. It would have been nice if the restaurant would have taken responsibility when finding out that we did not believe the steak was cooked properly and fixing it. So, we basically just consider this a lost $200. Based on this experience I would not recommend this place.",2019-02-28 20:34:50

My pops was there, my wife was there and I was there.
It's been years since I stepped foot into MiCasa Too and I was anxious to try them for dinner. I have been there for lunch and they were okay.

They do not take reservations. The person on the phone, when we called stated that the time we wanted to come in was not normally busy.
That was right. We got there at 6:00 PM and it was empty.

We were acknowledged and seated promptly. 
But something just felt wrong when you're in a restaurant and it's empty.
That changed as our meal was being prepared, people started to come in. At first, a few couples, then a party of 4 followed by two large parties.

Service was fair but mostly friendly. They may not have had enough employees, but after I ordered a beer, it took way to long for it to find its way to my table. But, it did eventually.

I ordered the taco/chile relleno combo #5 for $14.45.
It was huge, but I came with an appetite. It was plated nicely and smelled good.
The taco was crispy and fresh. But the relleno was ""okay"". It was very breaddy. Not my style. But, nonetheless, I ate it.

The environment was classic Hispanic decor and the tables and floor were clean.

But, the reason why I gave it three stars is it was only okay.

4 out of 5 * 

Food 5/5 - 
Food was very good. The pork sliders, with their weird spongy tortilla bread, were fantastic. The lobster spring rolls were good. The sushi tasted as fresh as Tucson sushi can taste. We used a Wine Tasting and Tapas Groupon, so we were able to eat here at a slight discount. But this place is pricey compared to other sushi restaurants. Especially for the amount of sushi you get (esp with the rolls). If you want the most bang for your buck I'd say stick with the sashimi or nigiri sushi.  

Ambiance 4/5 - 
I liked the simple modern decor, especially the textured accent wall with the Buddha statues in the built in shadow boxes. The bar area is split in two, with one side serving sushi, and the other side serving drinks. Dress is Tucson casual. You can dress down here, and also feel free to dress it up a bit. 

Service 5/5 -
Service was great. Our server Whitney was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. 

Total Impression 4/5 - 
On the one hand, our first experience here was very good. On the other hand, I'm not sure I would drive all the way across town(45 minute drive) to come here again, at least without a financial incentive such as some sort of discount. I hope this place can do well without the use of Groupon to lure people in, unless of course that is part of the business model(I noticed that both sets of customers at the table next to us had Groupons). It's just that it was a tad pricey, esp if you are having any of the rolls. So keep a lookout for deals to this place and give it a try if you haven't already.",2012-06-18 23:31:42

Food: everything tasted as expected.. i enjoyed the rolls even though they were very simple~ it was decent quality and presented very nicely with a good rice to fish ratio.

Service: i was not happy about this... first the waiter came asking for our drinks twice.. then he took the liberty to add an extra dish without consulting with his customer... we were given vinegar instead of soy sauce and when we wanted service, he was no where to be found.. we had to frequently wave someone else down to request what we needed... i actually feel very hesitant to return for HH b/c of this...

overall experience: the place was packed! there was no privacy..  it was nice that we managed to get a table and seats.. but going to the bathroom could be a challenge... while i think this place has a lot of potential, perhaps the unexpected hype and crowd during the first couple weeks after opening got them a little disoriented.  i will give double knot another try.. but i do hope they organize some things a little better.",2016-03-02 15:26:53

However, our most recent visit was pretty mediocre. The staff/servers now all seem incredibly young (college students?) and inexperienced. Our server wasn't familiar at all with the drink/beer list, and wrongly described one of the dishes as not having onions and peppers (it did).

Also, the menu doesn't do a good job of describing what is in each dish. All key ingredients should be listed in case there are ingredients people don't like (like onions or peppers). Also, the specials, while sounding delicious on the menu, all came out as sort of afterthoughts made together with a minced overstock of seafood. For example, the ""stuffed"" shellfish-stuffed mahi mahi just tasted like a 'kitchen sink' of seafood all mixed together.

Probably won't be coming back; there are way better restaurants in downtown St. Petersburg.",2021-05-03 13:23:54

Between new staff, new menus, and new everythings with new restaurants, it's difficult to get a clear reading, but Garces has it down at his Trading Co.  

Staff:  Pleasant, knowledgeable, attentive.  Many looked a bit nervous, I didn't see too many smiles, but I think it was their anxiety to perform well that showed, rather than a disinterest in being there.  

Food: I ordered the Minestrone soup to share and the ingredients were super fresh.  Portion was good to share & to have as a side for my sandwich.  As my main dish I had the Tartine aux Fromage, which was listed under the ""sandwich"" section of the menu.  It was an open face sandwich, not good for the extreme hungry, but very tastey.  The brioche was crisp, tomatoes fresh, and vinegar very refreshing.  My boyfriend ordered the Moroccan sandwich and liked it (not loved it).  Overall the sandwiches are good, but not mind blowing, and not the typical over-sized portion - so if you are hungry, get an app as well.    

Dessert: I tried the coconut tart which was f-ing great.  If you like bits of coconut, and a nice crusty pastry, definitely try this.  

What others had: I took a look around the restaurant and noticed a delicious pizza that was ordered.  The pizza is sizeable, and can feed at least two, if not three to share.  Next time I must have this!  

Why 4 stars: Well, I love brunch.  And there is no brunch menu (at the moment they only serve lunch and dinner).  Please Mr. Garces, provide me with a breakfast sandwich and I will gladly update my review to 5 stars.",2010-02-20 20:25:41

So... just a word of warning.  If you are sensitive to tightly packed places, you might avoid this one if you can't sit outside.   I won't be back until the world is back to normal.  It just didn't feel right.

I ordered the standard cheeseburger with grilled instead of raw onions and a side of fries. I need a baseline.

The burger was smaller than I expected, but it was packed with flavor. The patty was greasy and smashed thin. It was juicy on the inside, but slightly seared around the edges. The bun was glimmering (with grease, probably). The cheese was melting. Everything worked together so well. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had in Nashville. Tip: add a bit of the Alabama white sauce for an extra kick of flavor.

The fries weren't as amazing as the burger, but that would be a monumental task for any potato.

I do wish the food had been a bit warmer, especially considering how quickly it was brought to the table. But it was so good (and I ate it so fast), I can't complain too much. Also, the small metal tray that the food was served on did not cooperate with the sealed-finish table top. It slid off the table (thankfully after I was done eating), spraying my jeans and shoes in ketchup. So some grips on the bottom of those trays would be nice.

This was my first visit to the Martin's Downtown Nashville location, and it blew me away. The multi-level setup is fantastic considering the crowds a place like this will draw in a growing and tourist-heavy city. The atmosphere is just as fun as the Belmont location I visited when I first moved to Nashville. You'd never guess this location was brand new. And the staff was stellar.

This was for dine in experiences. However, I ordered for curbside pickup for Mother's Day over a week before the holiday with a 5:30 pickup stating you would go to the door, call the number, and it would come out to you. I arrived at 5:20 and had to call 3 times before someone answered who said to wait in the car and it would come out shortly. At about 6:10 I started to call again, calling 16 times either being hung up on, sent to voicemail, or just let rang. I finally decided to get out of my car and wait with about 30 people - totally not CDC recommended - where a woman asked if I wanted to cancel my order. No I want my food for Mother's Day that i ordered 10 days ago and you knew you needed to cook. Plus the money came off of my card immediately. Youve already paid for this meal. How can I trust I would get a refund when you can't even order or cook food correctly when ordered 10 days in advance??

I asked how long it would take which she didn't know but could ask. She took about 20 others names before disappearing in to the restaurant for over 15 minutes with no one getting their food.  She finally came out after about 20 minutes with one bag of food for another patron but didn't ask how long my order would take. Said it's up to the kitchen. I said could you ask? She disappeared again and I attempted to call the restaurant 3 more times with it not even ringing. Hostess returned 10 min later with 1 order and still didn't check on the time for my order. At this point it was 6:35 and I was supposed to pick up my order at 5:30. Many people have decided to cancel so that should help the speed of my order right? Did they have any intentions of ever fulfilling any orders? At 6:40 I called 3 more times, phone doesn't even ring. At 6:42 general manager came out and I asked how much longer and he said he's an hour behind. I said I've been here well over and hour so where does that leave me? And he said let him check and he went back in hostess came back out to form a line of people canceling. Additionally, manager was wearing a mask but pulled down around his neck so his nose and mouth were exposed. So very safe and protective of covid. I said all I wanted to know was how long my order would take for the 3rd time and she said she asked the kitchen and has no idea and to ask a manager, using quite an angry tone. I said I just spoke to him and he did not know and she said that's the best she can do. Then the hostess told a customer she would prefer to be home with her kids as well and continued to take cancelation names. Every 7 minutes or so, the hostess would come out with a bag and yell a name before disappearing back into the restaurant. Absolutely impossible to get ahold of her but I guess she hasn't had answers to my questions for 45 minutes so why ask? Attempted to call 3 more times around 6:55 with no answer. Phone won't even ring at this point. Finally got our 5:30 order at 7pm. Take it to the car to check the order and it is for the wrong Sullivan. Got the managers attention a few min later and it's back to the waiting game. 

Finally got the correct order at 7:05. They were out of egg rolls so I was given a cheesecake?? How does that compare? An appetizer for a dessert? We made our own family dessert. & gave extra salmon...

Got home. Potatoes and Brussels ice cold. Ribeye ice cold. Caesar salad has no dressing and croutons so it's just lettuce with cheese. I will say the steak was delicious. Sullivan's does make a great steak! The potatoes and Brussels were good once heated.

I waited weeks until writing this review so I don't sound like I'm ranting... so here goes.

It wasn't crowded even for a Saturday night.  There seems to be a lot of servers who do a lot of walking around, but nobody is talking to guests, or bussing tables, or carrying food.  We flagged at least 3 different people and finally managed to get someone after over 30 minutes of being seated.  The waitress who finally took our order seemed friendly and took our order and had it memorized.  Bad mistake!  Ended up getting our orders wrong.  My brother ordered the chicken marsala and got eggplant parm.  My brother in law ordered an appetizer that never came.  And his over-priced order of lasagna looked so sad and small.  When the marsala finally came out, it was one pathetic looking chicken breast. I was fortunate enough that my order was fine.  My chicken parm was cooked fine, but my side of angel hair and marinara tasted like it was from a jar.  However, even if all our food came out on time, the sub mediocre quality and taste of food does not justify the price.  The waitress non-chalant attitude didn't help either.  Nor did her responses that made us feel that this was somehow our fault.

Maybe we shouldn't have ordered Italian food?  Maybe it's better as lunch.  I read good stuff about their Cubans and black beans and rice.  Or maybe this place should just stick with their margaritas and bar fare... This place was definitely not a good pick for us and we will definitely not be headed back.

They have one of the most knowledgeable and pleasant staff members of any place in the city.

The atmosphere of the place is perfect for an intimate meal and the small plates, salads, sandwiches, and cheese plates give you the option to go all out and eat a huge meal or keep it low key but still have some tasty bites.  I enjoy sitting at the bar when possible because you can really ask a lot of questions and interact a little more with the bartenders.

The good: Some friends and I wanted to meet up in center city and catch up and Sampan was perfect for that occasion. We got the chicken bao bun, kimchee fried rice, and the short rib chow fun. I personally enjoyed the chicken bao bun. It was slightly spicy, but very flavorful with the only drawback being I ate it to fast xD. The kimchee fried rice is a nice staple, but nothing that really surprised me. For happy hour, you typically sit at the bar which gives you a nice view of the kitchen, which I appreciated. It's also a nice place where you can show up casual or slightly dressy and not stand out. 

The bad: The wait can be long if you come on a busy day during happy hour. The happy hour menu isn't super exhaustive, but you definitely can swing by a few times before feeling like you've had the entire menu.",2016-12-10 17:03:38

We ordered the roasted carrot hummus, the fresh fall salad, and a ravioli dish with rabbit and celery in a brown butter sauce. 

I wasn't too amazed by the carrot hummus. I thought it lacked flavor. I was excited to try the breads that it was served with because I had heard good things. Maybe if it had been fresh out of the oven I would have enjoyed it more, but again, I wasn't impressed. 

The fall salad had escarole, peas, and a ""tonnato"" sauce, which to me tasted like a glorified fishy mayonnaise. Upon a Google search, I have determined that is what it was anyway. It was refreshing but not very well plated. 

I enjoyed the raviolis the most. The wait between our first two dishes and this one was quite long and I'm hoping that meant that they were made to order. We ordered the smaller version of the plate and ended up with three ravs each. You can't really go wrong with a brown butter sauce- delicious. It was topped with bits of rabbit, which were tender and flavorful. There was a creamy, whipped celery filling inside. This was definitely the best part of our meal. 

I think of myself as a baller on a budget. I like to enjoy good food but can't do so all of the time because I'd be poor af. Maybe I would have been more impressed with the quality of other substantial entrees and less starters, but the prices did not allow for that. Which brings me to a discussuon topic I'd like to throw to throw out here: 

When did small, tapas-esque plates that were once known for their affordability turn into an opportunity for restaurants to serve small, well made plates, for an obnoxious price? I understand that quality will increase the price, but to continue to boast that you serve small style plates for the same price as a full meal at other places seems a little greedy to me. Or maybe I'm just stingy. Idk.

Regardless, we ordered enough for two moderately hungry people and were full by the end. 

Would I recommend to others? Maybe. It's nice for a date and if you're not concerned about price.",2017-10-20 12:53:41

In the past, we've gone to Red Star and the food is vibrant in color and flavorful, but a bit salty (read my earlier review). This time we decided to try Yummy Yummy because it's so close. Ordering online was super easy, and you can still pay when you pick up. Prices were average for take-out. Parking was in short supply (read: you'll probably end up parking illegally).  Inside is generic Chinese fast food look (linoleum floor, cheesy looking dining chairs and table) and a little dark. It looks like they run a lunch buffet. There were quite a few people dining in. I ordered the chicken lo-mein combo. It came with pork fried rice and an egg roll. DH ordered the shrimp with Chinese vegetables and a side of steamed rice. The egg roll was the first thing I tried and it was really good, so I was looking forward to the meal. I opened the container and was immediately disappointed. The rice was pale with no visible bits of onions or veggies that I typically see in fried rice. The bits of pork were anemic. The lo mein was darker than any I've ever seen.  Neither item had much flavor.  Even after being doused with soy sauce. Actually, both items tasted exactly alike. :-/

I tried some of DHs entree and it was better, but still nothing to write home about.

I had three tacos--Mahi Mahi, pollo, and carnitas.  They were deliciously prepared and the (what I presume to be) homemade sauces provided great extra flavor. They also have Boylan's fountain soda which is really just to die for. 

And now, the airing of grievances (Seinfeld style):

1. The tacos are pretty small considering the price (about 4 a pop). I guess that might be so you can sample a selection of the offerings but no one wants to feel they're not getting any bang for their buck. 

2. It doesn't seem like there's enough seating to accommodate a lunch crowd. The turnover was fast enough and it wasn't an issue for my crew of four but I could def see it being a problem. 

3. There's at least one discrepancy on the menu (tecate is either $2 everyday or $4.50 depending on where you see it) that annoys me because I think pricing should be straightforward and clear. It just seems to me the error allows for a loophole of charging customers more if they're not looking closely. 

4.  Lastly, the power situation. While we were there yesterday, there was a power outage. I'm in no way blaming that on Buena since it appeared to cover a few blocks in the surrounding area but, the way it was handled by the staff left a lot to be desired. Namely, they just said ""sorry folks"" and watched as diners attempted to wait it out or customers who hadn't placed orders yet filed out. I would've expected some sort of customer retention effort. After about 10 min of no power (windows allowed plenty of daylight to see), no updates, and increasing heat since the air conditioning was off, we left, too.

I ordered chicken shumai as an appetizer. Honestly, this wasn't anything special. It was fine, but probably nothing I would order again. For my entree, I got the mala soup bowl. They have different levels of heat ranging from 0-3. I got the highest which is simply ""very spicy."" When requesting this, the server warned that this was indeed very spicy. I knew this was a good sign. And, boy, was the server right!

When getting the mala soup bowl, you must choose from at least five ingredients. This is a non issue as they have many to choose from (veggies and meats). I went with Japanese tofu, enoki mushrooms, beef, whole shrimp, tripe, and the hand shaved noodles. All ingredients were great. The whole shrimp was a highlight for me. Usually, with whole shrimp, you need to work for it a little. Break apart that head and suck the goodness out. Then, work the tail. After working with the first one, I realized that I could just eat the shrimp whole. Head, outer shell, and all. I almost found it better this way as the soup was infused between the shrimp and shell making it a much better bite to just get into it. The preparation on the shrimp was great alone.
The beef was tender and took on he flavor of the broth. The tripe had that little crunch to it that I love. Japanese tofu is unlike your typical tofu. Tofu that most are familiar with is firm. Japanese tofu is more soft and almost melts in your mouth. Enoki mushrooms gave a stringy texture and also had a nice slight crunch/chew to it.
This place is known for its handmade noodles and I loved the hand shaved noodles in my bowl. It had a nice chew to it which complimented everything.

When getting this, it's A LOT of food for the normal appetite in my opinion. I came in hungry, and was full half way through. I just couldn't stop though because of how delicious the ingredients were and the lava soup base kept me wanting more and more. And, it stayed virtually piping hot the entire time.
When it comes to the spice level, even at its highest, it's not like it's an unbearable heat where you can't enjoy the food. I loved it. The spice hits you from the get go, and the Sichuan flavors give you that wonderful numbing and tingling feeling (if you're into that sort of thing). Next time, I think I'll get one level lower for spice. Simply because I wanted to slurp up the rest of that soupy goodness that was infused with all the ingredients I had in it. But I just couldn't because the soup broth just clung to my throat.

Overall, I'd pass on the chicken shumai next time around. Maybe try something else. But, that mala soup bowl is enough for me to come back over and over again.",2019-02-24 12:56:11

Word of advice: if you come here after Honeygrow City Ave, which I rated as 5 stars, you're bound to be disappointed with this location.

Honeygrow stores always seem rockin' for pretty great reasons: it's a local company, the flavors are great, and the food is locally sourced. A little overpriced for noodle bowls, as the meat feels like an afterthought. Personally, I prefer more meat-focused meals from wok-shops like Pei Wei. But the food is good, and you gotta respect Honeygrow's mission. 

I tried the Philly Roast Pork tonight, and it was pretty enjoyable, with authentic flavors of roast pork sandwiches that you'd get in the Philly sandwich spots. The asiago cheese shavings & pepper flakes are what elevate the Philly Roast Pork to being a delicious dish. You can only get the Philly Roast Pork in Philly's regional Honegrow stores; it's not available in New York or Balt/DC (they have their own regional dishes). Previously at City Ave, I really enjoyed the Spicy Garlic (with chicken). 

Here's the rub with 16th Street: it's small, people trip over you (or you trip over them), there are only small numbers of tables for all the people that come through here, and the fact that all your orders are served in a paper container. I'm sorry, but it just feels cheap and chinzy to have to eat out of a tightly-packed Chinese-style paper carton; whereas the City Ave store serves out of a neat stone black bowl.

I LOVE INDIAN food but I was really not enjoying this meal as much as I did at other Indian restaurants Ive had before.

I had a Indian Chai Tea, it was good. My boyfriend had a can of sprite. we didn't get any appetizers. I ordered the Lamb Jal Frazie and my boyfriend had a Chicken something, it was light yellow orangey with a thick sauce. It came with rice so I ordered plain naan with the meal.

The thin indian tortilla crispy thing they gave us at the beginning was good. Its served with that green lightly spicy sauce, a tangy sweet brown sauce and a red/pinkish chopped onion thing. 

So the meal started off great, I was expecting the food to be great as well. But I was deeply disappointed, we didn't wait too long after we ordered. It came out about 10 minutes later.

My boyfriends dish LOOKED good, the sauce looked thick and tasty and mine I could already tell it wasn't like what I have ordered at other indian restaurants before. The sauce on mine was really runny and wasnt a thick sauce. The rice was perfect though, light and fluffy. The naan nice, hot and toasted.

I tried my boyfriends it was good...but not as great as ones I've had before, it lacked stronger indian spices.

Mine, I enjoyed how tender the lamb was but I really did not like the consistency, too runny and I felt like they just poured fresh tomato puree and used very little indian spices to it, so the indian flavor taste lacked A LOT.

But I was starving so I finished a plate and we had left overs. There also wasnt enough salt on our dishes. I thought it might have just been me, but my boyfriend also mentioned it lacking salt. 

OVERALL

Service=Poor, tad bit slow, lacked enthusiam and professionalism. (except for when a older gentlemen came by he seemed like he was more head of the place, our waiter just seemed like he hated his job, and not once did he smile or seemed happy to be serving)

Food=Poor, although I enjoyed the rice and plain naan. The dishes lacked stronger indian spices, I felt like I could've just cooked those dishes at home. And it needed a tad more bit of salt.

Price=Fair, we paid $32 for our two dishes and two beverages and 2 orders of plain naan.

We won't be going there again. Hopefully theres a good indian restaurant somewhere here in Reno.",2011-01-18 00:53:07

Despite the fact that our server was completely overworked, she took good care of us and was patient and attentive.  There are a lot of good drink cocktails and other brunch drinks.  The prices are actually reasonable, which I didn't expect. 

For my brunch, I ordered an omelet with cheddar, monterrey jack, poblano, and corn.  The ingredients were fresh and made for a delicious omelet.   My omelet can with toast and below average breakfast potatoes.  I was dining with my friends Lacey and Megan.  Lacey ordered the bagel with lox; Megan went with crab, dill, Havarti and leek omelet with egg whites.  All of our dishes were well made and came out quickly.  Portion sizes were decent.

Bottom Line: I feel like a broken record when writing about Starr joints.  There's simply not much to say about the Continental.  He focuses on atmosphere, and the food is just okay.

It's the kind of place that's truly five star in my mind; it's somewhere I wouldn't mind eating just about every meal. The price, comfort, convenience, and taste put it in the upper echelon (alongside places like PW Pizza and Sugarfire Smokehouse).

The biggest downside gets itself out of the way first: The waiting situation. Sometimes -- no, often, at least on weekend mornings -- you'll need to wait outside for a bit. The host situation is a bit disorganized and occasionally you'll need to poke or prod to ensure you're remembered. If it's bad weather out, you may find yourself looming over some people who are in the midst of a meal, and I hate to unintentionally sour another diners' experience.

BUT, once the wait is through -- and it's seriously not bad at all -- you're in the money. The coffee is hot and good and fresh. The service is always friendly, down to the server who's joked ""I didn't know you spoke Spanish!"" on two separate occasions of ordering an entree with a Spanish name. And, best of all, the food is to die for.

Just about anything at Southwest would be super satisfying, but I prefer to keep it simple: Expertly scrambled eggs, crunchy big hash browns, think strips of bacon or sausage pucks. There are some Southwestern-themed additions you can get if you like (hot sauces, sopapillas) that are icing on the cake. The specials, too, have been good each time we've tried one. I really don't think you can go wrong.

Bottom line is, try Southwest for breakfast, brunch, or lunch one of these days. You're really going to enjoy it. And if you loom over me while I eat, well, I may just pass you a hash brown or two.",2013-03-06 21:30:25

personally, i went with the pulled pork sandwich. soooooooooooo delicious. i had to eat it as an open-faced sandwich in the beginning because it was just too big and there was so much meat i couldn't even compress the sandwich enough. the bbq sauce was oozing everywhere, and although that made for a pretty messy meal, it left my stomach and taste buds extremely happy. their handcut fries were also very impressive, even after they got cold.

Results have been mixed, but I continue to have this image of being presented with a very heavy plate of food.  This is a meat and potatoes restaurant.  The décor seems to have been upgraded just about every time I've been there.  Not with a lot of imagination;  the theme seems to be ""a tribute to Helen"" who is the Syberg brothers' grandma.  The end result of these upgrades?  I would describe it as one of the nicest restaurants in Fargo.  Not prompting any of our locals to take pictures, to be sure. 

The sleek Applebee's-type menus aren't doing them any favors, in my opinion - just makes them seem like a chain and sets my expectations low.

The three of us each had meat and potatoes:  I had a bacon and blue cheese burger.  The burger was huge and the meat seemed to be quite lean, which is how I like it, but not good if you want juicy.  Fries were limp and undercooked - a definite disappointment.   The wife had the half fried chicken (Sunday special - $7.95).  It was cooked perfectly, but seemed to be seasoned only with salt and pepper.  Nothing special - can't complain much for the price.  The little one had chicken fingers and fries.  The chicken was not good, like maybe it was frozen/microwaved.  

Meh's all around.  Service was great, but the kitchen? I get the feeling their heart's not really in it.  Based on my other Syberg's experience, maybe you should go with the wings or pizza.  I guess we'll go back in a few years.  It's convenient.",2011-07-07 20:04:27

This ""Chef's Selection"" entree was ordered as an appetizer, which is a very clever way for the whole table to get in on the act (Good job Mom!). For you see, the ""Cavatelli Bada Bing"" is prepared table side (for a video, head to the URL - It's on the ""Menus"" page). It's hard to find the words to describe this one-of-a-kind creation, but just imagine fresh pasta, flambeed with vodka, then dumped INTO a huge wheel of Parmesan cheese (to soften it). While it's softening, prosciutto, basil, tomatoes and a touch of red pepper (""To open the taste buds"") are also flambeed. Now the pasta, and a generous portion of the softened cheese, are scrapped from the wheel and mixed with the prosciutto. Absolutely fantastic. On this dish alone 5 stars were in the bag, only a disaster would keep this review from a perfect score. Do note that this a very rich dish, and I personally think it would be way too much as a main, but I do think it is absolutely perfect as an antipasti. 

OK, so now onto the rest of the meal, which was also quite good. 

Cesar salad + Pizza Biancaneve (a white pizza), a lasagna bolognese, a Spinach salad + the Calamari appetizer as a main, and for me the Rigatonacci alla Vodka with the Wedding Soup as a side (vs. a salad). None of these dishes disappointed, though the lasagna, clearly in a baked dish, was just barely above warm. If mom was not so hungry, I think she would have sent it back. 

Service was very refined. Very nice dining environment. I was also told there are some good early bird specials (Mom & Bob like to see an early movie at Baywalk and then have dinner here).

Note: There are lunch and dinner hours. Lunch ends at 4PM, and then it's dinner. There's no break in the action, just (I suspect) a menu change.

I didn't want to be a burden, so I just ordered from the lunch menu and had the Shrimp Tchefuncte. Very good! It's not a heavy dish at all, but the deep brown roux made the dish for me and made me feel like I was having true cajun (albeit touristy) fare. Unfortunately, I had a few bites left on my plate and I noticed a hair on my plate that wasn't mine or the people sitting next to me. It goes without saying that I was completely turned off, but I had finished most of my plate and at that point found protesting pointless. After what had transpired, if I were to come back to NOLA, this place would most surely not be my first, middle, or last stop.",2017-06-10 18:47:34

          The food however is quite good. Most of their pho has the same broth that is salty with a strong beef flavor. It's a bit too salty but the flavor is nice and the salt can be balanced with limes and bean sprouts. The noodles are nice and bouncy and the meat is quite tasty. When I had the shrimp the portion was small but it tastes alright. The pork chops are similar to that respect.

There's a learning curve for every employee and unplanned issues don't always show up during a soft open. This is simply a recount of my experience. As a wise neighboring customer said, what's important is the food. The service and logistics can be fixed, but you have to have good food.]

Mesa Burger opened yesterday. The space is nice and clean with the typical feel of a casual order-at-the-counter restaurant. The outdoor patio is relatively spacious considering the location. With the cool temps, they had a few heaters placed around the patio. Unfortunately, those who sat at the outward facing patio counter would have no heat. So, for the next couple of months, bring your puffy coats if you want to eat in after the sun goes down!

The open kitchen provided a view of Cat Cora working amongst a few other kitchen staff. The place was almost full but there was no one in line except one party in front of us. We took a good minute to look at the menu. Being my first time, I wanted to try the Mesa Burger, which is essentially a classic no-frills burger - lettuce, pickle, onion, special sauce. I was a bit shocked at the price ($10) but considering the town and CC's name, it was worth a try. I love me some French Fries and was swayed by the option for parm-truffle fries.

We placed our orders at 7:20 PM. We grabbed our drinks, sat at a table on the patio and waited. There were still seats available, but the chill in the air probably convinced people to place takeout orders instead. After 10 or 15 minutes we noticed that very little food was being delivered to any table on the patio. We overheard an employee noticing that one table of four had been waiting a long time and left to inquire at the kitchen. Since that table was there before us, my friend took the opportunity to run over to CVS. I took the opportunity to read my book.

After my friend returned, the table of four finally got food. Unfortunately, it was one out of the four orders. The other three had to still wait and watch their friend eat. After the one meal was finished, two other people received their food. So, one person was still left hungry while one person was left to watch others eat. During this time, I went ahead and added the business to Yelp to add a tip in case anyone was looking to come by.

My friend noticed a table behind me getting some food. The table had gotten there well after we ordered and sat at a table. My friend flagged a runner down to ask her to inquire about the status of our order and mentioned the other table as a point of reference. The runner proceeded to offer an excuse that the other table's order was most likely received by the kitchen before ours as if we had placed orders simultaneously and it was a technical issue. I understand the need to offer an excuse as a way to ease concern and defend any issues, but this was more frustrating because her logic wasn't sound and we simply wanted a status update after seeing what happened at the other table. She disappeared and after a few more minutes, we saw her cleaning a different table.

At 45 minutes since we placed our orders, I decided to get up and go inside to inquire myself. As I got up, Chris (who I assume is the owner) arrived at our table to apologize for the wait and offered us a credit for a future visit. He did acknowledge that it was opening day and the kitchen was overwhelmed. We appreciated the gesture and his candor. In the end, my burger showed up 50 minutes after placing the order. My friend's burger came about five minutes later.

The burgers were good, substantial meat patty cooked medium and good flavor. My Mesa Burger was pretty well balanced. The sauce was a bit too drippy so that I constantly had sauce dripping off my hands. But I liked the sauce and had no shame licking it off my hands. The brioche bun was nice, not too fragile but soft enough to not have to tear the bun.

The portion of fries seems a bit too modest to justify charging an extra $1 or $2 dollars for different toppings or sides. The portion of sweet potato waffle fries looked substantial for the extra charge. But luckily, the cashier did not charge me for the parm-truffle upgrade. The parm-truffle fries tasted good. I tasted the plain fries and they look and taste almost like McDonald's fries with black pepper.

Chris came back to offer us free ice cream sandwiches, which we got to-go because we needed to leave soon. I felt really uncomfortable with Chris coming over to offer us a credit and then offer to give us free ice cream sandwiches because we were sitting right next to a couple having a similar issue. Luckily, a server offered them ice cream sandwiches too.

Despite the big issue of the kitchen not being able to keep up with the orders going in, the food was good and fills a burger void in the Mesa. Good enough to keep coming back? Only if I'm in the neighborhood.",2016-12-07 07:51:59

Just glancing at the menu, I was really happy to see that they offered many vegan, paleo and dairy free options because that's hard to find at most restaurants in New Orleans. There are two sides of the menu labeled ""Good Cat"" and ""Bad Cat."" The Good Cat side had the healthy breakfast/brunch/lunch options while the Bad Cat had more of the not so healthy stuff. I decided to try both sides because I wanted a little of both. I went with the chia seed pudding and blue crab scrambled eggs while the fiance got the more traditional bearcat breakfast with a side of paleo pancakes. Everything was outstanding, and their presentation makes for really scrumptious food photos! The chia seed pudding was my favorite because I haven't had chia pudding this good anywhere else, and I loved the fresh seasonal fruits, which included fig. The crab scramble was really tasty and had plenty of blue crab. Their breakfast potatoes were crispy and seasoned perfectly.

Food:  I've never had a good meal at Matador.  The range from terrible to okay, with most things falling into the ""okay"" category.  Lunch prices are okay, but you'll pay too much for what you get for dinner.  Mexican food can be so much better.

Bottom line is I think Matador would be a good choice to meet friends and have a drink and light snacks (ie: chips & avocado) - a time when food and service is inconsequential to your experience.  In that case, Matador can be an excellent venue.

Lucky for them I guess I came back.  The first time, the bartender had a mohawk and was awesome, everything you could expect from a bartender, engaging, knows his stuff, simply excellent service.  The decor is amazing, the food is amazing.  You can just skip the entrees and go tapas style with their many selections of appetizers and happy hour specials including gator corn dogs and boudin balls.  The only drawback is the hard hipster walls which reflect sound and turn it into a sound cave.  Otherwise, everything was about as perfect as you could imagine with great cocktails and lots of indie local beers including a good selection of bourbons and scotch.  Unlike other NOLA restaurants it wasn't this old-fashioned pretentious thing with dirty window sills and grimy 1812 bathrooms.  Or it wasn't one of those kitchen dive diner places.  This is upscale, classy and has a cool, casual, unpretentious feel.  That was until the next visit.  There are three people at the bar and I can't get a drink.  I wait.  I wait.  I wait.  I walk around.  I hit the restroom.  I wait.  I wait.  I wait.  Not even a glance or ""I'll be right with you.""  Just nothing.  Did I suddenly turn into a potted plant?  There were two female bartenders too!  Then one finally realizes there's some odd fellow sitting at the end of the bar, and maybe, perhaps, not certain, but perhaps maybe he wants something, shall I dare ask?  Would that be appropriate?  Is that a NOLA thing?  Dude walks into a bar, and he doesn't want anything, he just wants a seat and look around for like half-an-hour and then leave.

Finally, I get served and after dumping off my drink and food, nothing.  Meanwhile, the hefty lady starts gabbing with the old couple at the bar.  She's quite the cocktail expert.  Not the bartending expert, mind you, the cocktail expert.  She seems quite impressed with herself, and she's trying to upsell the old couple thinking they're loaded, they'll give her a huge tip and order several cocktails.  This happens to me ALL the time.  Never sit at a bar or winery tasting bar next to an old couple, because everyone thinks they're loaded and will drink everything.  I was at Grgich Hills doing a reserve tasting (not to brag but it's relevant here) and next to me is some old couple SHARING a basic tasting and the server is all over them like purple on grape skin.  How stupid can you be?  They left without ordering anything, and I wanted to get a Reserve bottle of chard but left pissed off to hell.  Same deal here.  The bartender from NYC gives them a free tequila sample and they choke on it.  How the f ck are they supposed to order and appreciate all your wonderful cocktails when they're choking on a sip of reposado???  Here's another clue.  They ordered Dos Equis and I ordered a local beer.  Any f cking clue there that they appreciate any kind of liquor?  You order Dos Euis because you're fake.  You're into image not substance.  You want to be like the Most Interesting Geezer instead of being one.  Meanwhile, I'm a f cking potted plant!  I've been to Kentucky and visited three distilleries.  I've drank more cocktails than this couple combined and probably the bartender too.  I knew more about scotch than the bartender before and I don't even drink scotch.  So what the f ck ever SoBou.  Do your stupid demographic profiling and go f ck yourself.",2014-03-25 21:08:51

The decor is humble, no thrills diner.

Our coffees were simple but delicious. 
My boyfriend ordered some kind of Philly cheese steak egg concoction. I was deciding between the two goat cheese egg dishes and asked Mike (one of the servers) for his recommendation and he veered me towards ""the Guatemalan"" i really liked his energy and trusted his recommendation so I went for it. Also I ordered a side of chocolate chip pancakes.

EVERYTHING was delicious. The philly cheese steak egg concoction was fluffy and full of flavor, creamy melted cheese, hearty eggs and a nice serving of meat on tomato sauce- soooo good.  My Guatemalan was of course very light in comparison. two eggs over easy, some avocado, two warm tortillas, tomato salsa, and a side of the most delicious beans. my test for this dish was in the beans- this could have been a throwaway dish, but instead the beans were made with so much care, and full of flavor with chopped peppers and onions, a dish within itself, though just a small side on my dish. 

The chocolate chip pancake was also to die for. We literally couldn't fit it but we tried. Ended up taking most of it to go and eating it for a snack later in the evening. Our server Clay was also really attentive. Though the restaurant was always busy our waters and coffees were always filled. Both him and Mike sort of tag teamed and helped each other out. Mike also came often to our table and refilled our coffees. We felt really taken care of. 

I also really appreciated that when I asked Mike for a recommendation, both the dishes I was asking between were priced much higher than the one he recommended. He could have gone for an upsell and recommended something to rack up our bill, but instead he was honest and told me what he really liked on the menu.

Their menu is well-rounded with sandwiches, soup/salads, wraps, entrees, sides and sweets. The restaurant is simple and clean. 

The 'Take it to the House' option on the menu is marketed as feeding two adults and two children. The lady I spoke to said that her and her husband could eat most of the food when they do this option but I think it could easily feed three adults as well based on the amount of food that we had leftover. I called in the order before I got off of work for something easy to bring home and they had everything ready when I arrived and checked-in at the register. They asked if I wanted to pay over the phone so that I could just take it immediately so I did pay over the phone which was convenient. 

The food option I ordered allows you to choose one entree, two sides and it comes with 4 orange rolls (or in my case we did 2 yeast 2 orange but I wish we did all orange because those are fantastic). We also got a half gallon of sweet tea. The total was about $40 but lasted us for two meals. We chose the chipotle braised pork, hot cheddar pasta and roasted vegetables. We enjoyed all the food except we noticed that the carrots in the roasted vegetables were almost raw and too crunchy so we picked those out. The pulled pork was good and the barbecue sauce they gave us on the side went great on it. The hot cheddar pasta is just like mac n cheese but with penne instead of macaroni.

I wouldn't really say there was anything special about this place, but It's a great, easy Italian place to get dinner without having to fuss or emptying out your wallet, or having to go to a national chain.

The atmosphere is open and bright and lively. It makes everything feel fresh and friendly, but it's maybe a bit modern considering how standard the fare is. The noise level doesn't get too loud, helped by the fact that the restaurant is split up into three areas, but the whole place doesn't feel disconnected.

The food is pretty good too. Nothing to write home about, maybe a 3-3.5/5 but it's reasonably priced and sometimes you can even get some really good deals.

Because of where it's located, you will pretty much have to valet park, or be prepared for a walk, neither of which is a bad thing because it's in a beautiful walking area and the valet is quick.

The only problem with this place is that it feels a bit... impersonal. The food is so standard that it feels almost like a national chain even though it's not, but it doesn't have any of that forced 'when you're here you're family' vibe that most national chains do. It doesn't feel homey, and it definitely doesn't feel like you're enjoying 'mamma's ancient family recipes,' but it's still enjoyable.

When scoping out their menu before visiting, I had initially planned on trying a few different tacos but at the last minute, decided on a Casita Bowl. I figured this would be a good way to test out a lot of what they have to offer at one time.

Ordering a Casita Bowl presents the option to accompany your main grub with a side of tortilla chips or corn tortillas. I opted for the tortillas because they advertise that they're made in house and after tasting them, I'm confident that I picked the winner. Seriously, go for the tortillas (I mean, how amazing could tortilla chips be?).

On to the main attraction -- Everything about the bowl was fresh and delicious. The perfectly spiced chorizo, the creamy guacamole, the pico de gallo, even down to the rice and beans base. It also bears mentioning that I had plenty of leftovers even after using the provided tortillas to make and wolf down three DIY monster tacos.

While waiting on my takeout, I couldn't help but notice that the place was packed. There was a steady stream of new customers coming in to order their lunch and both the inside and outside seating were nearly full to capacity. The staff is friendly and the decor and feel of the restaurant itself is very cool.

I hate to keep the comparison train going but I will. I've eaten at both the Hillsborough and Central Avenue locations of Taco Bus dozens of times over the years. Casita and the Bus both offer the same style of food, just done a bit differently, so it's hard not to discern which you prefer after trying both.

Well, I am happy to say that my expectations were well over blown, and after I got my head on straight, I really enjoyed the food here.

First off, we were greeted by one of the friendly servers who told us all about the menu, and answered a couple of questions.  Second, the food was server promptly, and looked delicious.  Thirdly, everything tasted amazing.  I ordered a Lamb Gyro Combo, and my wife ordered a Lamb Souvlaki Plate and a Greek Salad.  The meats were seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly.  The Pita tasted fresh, and the Tzatziki was super tasty.  The fries were awesome, and stuffing them in the Gyro was a twist I hadn't experienced before.  The salad and the rice were great side dishes, and the Stubborn Fountain drink hit the spot.  All around a great dinner.  So good, we will be back again to sample a few more things from the menu.

Positives: Reasonably priced happy hour, good app options.
Negatives: sticky menu, lame margarita, frazzled staff

I ordered a happy hour margarita. They didnt even shake this drink. Everything was thrown in a glass followed by ice, I had to stir with my straw. Unimpressed by this, but the other drinks looked decent. Especially the frozen drinks.

We ordered 3 apps. The goat cheese red pepper dip was not hot. Hard to scoop without breaking the crisp. The calamari was just okay. The breading lacked flavor, but I enjoyed the sauce. The star of the show were the empanadas. They were hot and had nice flavor. I liked the (peach) salsa? that came on the side. 

The POS system was down and the staff was so frazzled. It wasnt a big deal and we weren't bothered by it. Every employee that spoke to us was frazzled and it was a bit over the top.

Overall, I would probably only return for happy hour with no expectations. I recommend ordering a frozen drink based on their appearance.. they looked delish.",2019-06-12 20:42:36

For starters, it's a less hyped place; less of a tourist trap. 
The beignets are made to order and are pillowy delectable fried and fattening little treasures.  Thank goodness there are only 3 to an order.  I could eat more for sure in one sitting but my beignet gluttony aside, 3 is plenty.

There's no accounting for individual preferences so all I'll say is that to my palate these beignets trump the ones I've had at ""the other place.""  Try both while you're in town and make up your own mind, and then get back to us on Yelp. 

I do think however, you'll also enjoy less of a line and an opportunity to enjoy your treats in the tranquil and pretty outside garden here.
There was no line at all the last time I was here during the late afternoon.


A coffee, chicory or otherwise, and an order of fresh beignets is a perfect afternoon treat after a day of walking the French Quarter.

I called late at night on a Tuesday (didn't really expect anyone to pick up or for them to be open), but to my surprise someone picked up the phone. I could tell they were closing up, and said no worries, we'd call back another night and grab a pizza a little bit earlier. The woman on the phone was soooo nice, and she pretty much insisted that they make us the pizza, and that it was no problem at all! I told her we were coming from Center City Philly and would be about 15 minutes, and she insisted that was completely fine, no rush. On top of that, she even said ""drive safely"" before she hung up :-) 

When we got there, the doors were locked. I called to tell her I was outside, and she directed me around to a side door to pick up the pizza. To top it all off, the pizza was SO good. We will definitely be back next time we order pizza.

We had been moving all day long and were so exhausted and hungry, and were happy to be able to get a pizza to share after the long day.

I think it's the only time I've ever left a 25% tip when picking up a pizza :-) I was that impressed!",2013-06-20 18:15:26

Since it was National Oysters Day when my friends and I came to Peche, we decided to order 4 dozen oysters.  

Heather recommended that we ordered a sample of each oysters and that's what we did.  We also ordered the tuna dip, Brussel sprouts and fried bread.  

The oysters were really good and fresh.  At first we ordered 2 dozen but after about 5 minutes, we sent in an order to have 2 dozen more.  You can distinguish the oysters by the size and looks of the shells but they were all fresh tasting and delicious.  

I didn't care too much for the Brussel sprouts.  The fried bread were good but you have to eat them right away because they don't taste as good cold.  They were a bit salty on the outside but soft, chewy and sweeter on the inside.  It went great with the oysters.

I ended up checking off three numbers on the menu card: Shrimp sui mai, vegetarian Rice Roll, and Scallion pancakes. My three small plates were all good, but I've had better.

If this weekend's soft opening was any indication of what we can expect from Range, then St. Louis is in for a treat in the form of amazing burgers and ice cream.

The highlights:

LGBT Burger- Lettuce, goat cheese, bacon and tomato on top of a grass-fed beef burger. Incredible. My husband ordered this one and the only reason I didn't was because of...

ABC Burger- roasted apples, bacon, and Camembert cheese on top of a grass-fed beef burger. I had no words. The sweet apple flavor complemented the smoky bacon and cheese perfectly and that burger? I'm no expert on the difference between grass-fed cows vs. whatever else they feed cows, but this burger actually tasted like a better quality meat.

Pumpkin pie ice cream- They make their ice cream in-house with natural ingredients and it shows. This stuff really tasted like if pumpkin pie were originally intended to be an ice cream flavor. I think there were even bits of pie crust in it!! It had a perfect amount of sweetness and spice. 

Other things I tried that were only ""ok"":

- Bailey's ice cream- This one isn't totally fair because I didn't order it. I don't actually like Baileys liqueur, but my husband had it and I figured I should at least try. It REALLY tasted like Bailey's, which he loved and I imagine anyone else ordering it would as well. 

- Chocolate covered raspberry float- This was St. Louis Framboise and chocolate ice cream. I enjoyed the ice cream part of it, but realized I'm not as big a fan of framboise in general, so I didn't love it. It wasn't bad by any means, and again, if someone loved framboise, they'd probably love this! The flavors worked well together, though I could've used more chocolate. Then again, I could ALWAYS use more chocolate. 

After both of us having drinks, burgers, fries, and dessert, the bill was still less than $50 (before tip) which is a win in my book. 

The service was wonderful and even though their ""St. Louis Originals"" machine wasn't set up yet, they took my rewards card number and the owner said he'd ring up my points over at Bridge. Now that is good service!

 I love going to places like the bakery,  and watching other's reactions.. This bakery seems to make all the Poboy rolls in NOLA! The loaves are about a foot long, very light, but crispy on outside. The price is right! 3/$1.25 which is better than Hong Kong Market which has them 2/$1.  

I wasn't impressed with the Banh mi's. The variety of fillings is more than any other place in NOLA ( like 15 different kinds)  but the flavors were no where near as good as the Banh mi at Hong Kong Market. Here they were really just sandwiches with a bland pickle of daikon & carrot, and without whatever ""special sauce"" HKM puts on theirs.  I wouldn't get one here again.  I do like the way they wrap them to go and put a label on each one.  Also the automated roll slicer was an interesting addition.

I had to try new pastries. On a friend's recommendation I bought a 2 pack of cream rolls which look  a bit like a mushy poboy but are made with a slightly sweeter, dough. Inside it was filled with what I think was some kind of sweet cream cheese filling-- kinda like long cream cheese filled donuts. very good.

The banana candies were also good. They are dark, sesame coated gelatinous square sweets with peanuts inside. It's along the line of Turkish delight but chewier.

The third new sweet was a rectangle of some chewy black (? Bean filling?) sandwiched between a flakey rice paper type crust (reminded me of the rice paper covering of Perugia).  It was ok, but would take trying it a few times before I could decide if I liked the flavor or not.

They have a variety of 3 inch mini pies- the apple and ?sweet potato ones were good. The little pie dough crusts were some of the best I've had-very flakey and crisp, not doughy or chewy like usual bakery pie crusts. I tried one of the green steamed buns filled with a lot of  meat and, despite the color which was a little off putting to me, they were absolutely delicious, meaty, flavorful, and the texture was perfect. Not really like Chinese steamed buns which are always too doughy in texture for my taste and are more dough than filling.

I also liked the savory pastries filled with meat, meat and chestnuts. The ""dot"" method for separating the different types was, I thought, very clever, but I  did have a qualm about whatever red""ink"" they use to differentiate them.

In the restaurant, I had a cup of the won ton soup which was a simple thin broth with scallions and several dumplings. The broth wasn't very flavorful nor were the dumplings--and I'm spoiled by the won ton soup from Kim Ahn's which is delicious. 

We asked if the Ban Hoi Heo hoac was pressed vermicelli or rice wraps. The waitress assured us it was the rice wrappers, but it turned out to be pressed vermicelli. The flavor was good but other places are better.  That seemed to be the general consensus for all of us, all dishes from pho to vermicelli bowls to rice plates were ok but not really as good as other places.

The service in the restaurant was slow and not attentive. I wouldn't make another trip for the restaurant again- too many other more interesting Viet restaurant s, and others that are more flavorful and cheaper.

They do have a huge list of bubble tea flavors, and several I'd never seen: taro, soursop, red bean and mung bean, but bubble teas are expensive @$4.75 each.",2014-05-29 04:06:49

I ended up dragging two of my friends along during a recent trip back to Philly. Being a small-ish shop with only about 20 seats, we unfortunately didn't manage to get dinner reservations for their secret supper club, so we went for Sunday lunch instead. 

Talula's Daily is divided into two sections: the bakery & breakfast side, which you see when you first walk in, and the cafe & market side. I'll admit that I felt a twinge of disappointment when I first wandered into the cafe side and only saw a fridge filled with prepackaged sandwiches and salads, like the kind they have in Au Bon Pain. But then I turned around and saw a display case full of non-packaged food, which instantly redeemed my hopes! As it turns out, the food in the display case is priced per pound, and you can get it either in containers to go or heated up to eat at a table. I decided to try the mushroom risotto, which cost about $6 for a scoop and a half(ish). A bit expensive, and it could've been a little creamier, but it was still pretty delicious. Friend #1 got the sweet potato and apple soup, which was fairly thick and tasted more like applesauce than sweet potato. Friend #2 got the chicken with maple and mustard glaze, which was also pretty good - sweet, and surprisingly tender.

Meanwhile on the bakery/breakfast side, you can get different types of pastries, brownies, cookies, scones, etc as well as frittatas and breakfast sandwiches. I was still hungry so I ended up ordering the broccoli, onion, and cheddar frittata. For the same price as my risotto, it was so big I couldn't even finish it. I also got a free mudslide cookie (thank you, Yelp check-in deal!), which was incredibly chocolately and rich, almost like a brownie. Other cookie flavors they had that day were chocolate chip, sugar, and peanut butter.

Conclusion: I still like Talula's Garden (right next door) more for the sit-down aspect and the ambiance, but Talula's Daily is a quaint, homey option for a quick breakfast or lunch. If I had the chance, I'd definitely come back to try their supper club menu.",2014-04-14 15:19:05

Their excellent tap selection goes on a slight discount and those wonderful fries are available for $2. I was floored by the tap selection, and the bottles just make it look all the better. They will do samples of anything on tap for $1-2. I initially got the dark IPA sampler, which included four samples of different dark IPAs they had on tap at the time, and it actually ran about $6, making it cheaper than ordering each one individually, which I probably would have done anyway.
And we continued throughout the night with the samplers until we finally both ordered a pint. Then, quite tipsy, stumbled over to the Grove for the concert.
The next visit was for beer and dinner, after their happy hour on a Thursday. We sat at a table by the window, as the place was much more full than on the previous visit and the patio was impossible. Great service all around. My companion pointed out that she was handling about half the tables in the room and was still able to keep us happy with the amount of liquid in both our respective glasses of beer and glasses of water.
The food was also very, very good. I had a reuben and my companion had a burger. We split the two. The bread on the reuben was fantastic, as was the corned beef. The only thing I would dock them on is the lack of sauce: there wasn't enough of the dressing and there was no mustard to liven up the flavor. A lot of people don't put mustard on reubens though (a damn shame), so I can't dock them much.
The burger was a little dry and somewhat overcooked. It is grass-fed, and tasted like it, but it wasn't the most fantastic burger I've ever had. It was served on a challah roll though, which made it a lot better.
I also should remark about the music: top notch! They were using someone's iPod/MP3 player on shuffle, so we heard a lot of Built to Spill (it is Boise, after all), Modest Mouse, Local Natives and some other stuff that I like personally, and really aided to the atmosphere.
All in all, I don't know that it gets much better than this place in Downtown Boise. Great food, great atmosphere and, most importantly, fantastic beer!",2010-10-07 15:02:48

Everything is very attractive--the dining room, the food, the dishes, the staff...and attractiveness (or cuteness, cleverness, hipness, sexiness, trendiness, etc.) seems to be a very important feature of new Nashville restaurants these days. That's great. I'm not opposed to attractive. I like attractive.

But I like good food more.

I love Vietnamese food for its bold, fresh, complex flavors that are well balanced in each dish. While the food at Viu's is definitely fresh--it is certainly not bold or particularly balanced--at least not the dishes my lunch companion and I had (noodle bowl with shrimp; lotus root salad). They were both very tame, bland affairs.

I will say in both dishes the shrimp were cooked perfectly, no small feat.

OH, and a note to all recent Nashville emigre restaurateurs: You don't open a restaurant in the South and NOT offer real brewed iced tea. It's just obnoxious. And to be clear, fruit tea and flavored teas DO NOT COUNT!",2016-08-05 00:39:53

It's an amazing use of an historic building on Tucson's most cultured street, 4th Avenue. I was a little unsure how to rate the first experience, so when my mom called on Sunday and wanted to go there for brunch, I jumped at the chance to try it a second time, for a different meal.

My first visit was on a Thursday evening, for dinner. They weren't very busy but they said they had a big group coming in with an inside table reserved; we sat on the patio. It was chilly, and the staff spent some time getting another of the patio heaters working for us.

We ordered warm olives while we waited for our food; this included a mix of delicious giant olives and bland smaller olives, plus some bread to dip in the olives' oil. I ordered the Dragoon Session Sausage, which was quite good and came with roasted brussels sprouts and a cauliflower mash. I could have done without the mash; it was flavorless and didn't seem to add anything to the dish. The brussels sprouts, on the other hand, were surprisingly good, if slightly bitter. Service was slow, and I don't think the large table inside ever showed up (or they may have been the large group that sat outside after all), but it was a pleasant evening on the patio.

My second visit, Sunday brunch, went similarly. I waited perhaps 15 minutes for a macchiato, which was nevertheless good. They weren't very busy when we arrived at 11:30 but were much busier after noon hit. I felt like they were understaffed, because our waitress was frequently rushing around the patio trying to attend to a large number of tables, while we waited for her inside.

I ordered the day's special, an amazing french toast with golden raisins, a sugary pecan top-crust on the bread, creme fraiche, fresh fruit, and syrup. It was probably the best french toast I've ever eaten, and the slices of bread seemed more like someone had french toasted a small cake. It's the kind of food I would live on, if I had to pick just one thing to eat forever.

But again, service was slow. It took a long time to get each thing we needed, from drinks, to the food, and even the bill. When the bill came, it seemed low -- and it was. They had forgotten the macchiato and a hot toddy. We sat there at least ten minutes waiting for the waitress to be back inside so we could correct it.

I pondered for a while on whether to rate the Coronet at 4 or 5 stars. It's a great building, lovely furniture and decorations, and offering food you can't really find elsewhere in Tucson. It's fun to sit in the window and watch tourists, hipsters, art lovers, and stoners of all kinds wander past. And they give you plenty of time to do this while you're waiting for your waiter to reappear.",2015-01-26 17:01:03

I mean, I'd give it another shot, but the whole thing felt very sub-par to me. The decor and feel is funky and fun, but it was just missing something for me. 

Parking...virtually nonexistent, unless you come after 6pm then you can park in the lot behind Datz Dough. I'm willing to excuse for this, it's South Tampa. Next, the noise level. Yikes! Some weird techno type elevator music that was pretty loud. We couldn't even hear each other and that was after asking for it to be turned down. And also after being asked to be seated in the quietest area possible as there were 8 of us and we were having a book club meeting and wanted to talk. The restrooms - a place this busy only has a single restroom? Eek. And the music in there was a bit excessive. It's the potty for Pete's sake, who's going to be jamming out while working out their bodily functions?!

The important thing...the food and drinks. I did not order a drink, although my friend said her cosmo was delicious, and the Moscow mule looked pretty authentic. I'd come back for a drink. I ordered the cuban (Havana Hottie) and it was pretty good. Portion size is huge, as others have stated, but the sandwich was just okay. The spicy mustard was a little overwhelming and the bread was thick. The chips drizzled with sauce were really yummy, but not as good as EATS American Grill's. The menu is diverse with lots of options. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, and a plethora of appetizers. I've heard they have a great burger, but there is literally ONE burger on the menu. 

They have a lot of cupcakes and cakes, along with these super neat looking chocolates in the side area of the restaurant. Which makes no sense to me considering that Datz Dough is next door. I'll get to that in my Datz Dough review, but they don't have cakes or cupcakes over there because they can't repeat. Huh? It's the same place!",2013-07-10 02:44:06

Even with all that 4 stars. The food saves the place by being a solid 5 stars. I had vegetable soup and iced Vietnamese coffee. Both were excellent. I do wish that condiments were on the table because I wanted some, yet nobody came to check on me. My friend got curry and she really enjoyed hers too.

Based on the rave reviews of Sidney Street Cafe, I have been longing to eat here. My husband surprised me by making a reservation here through OpenTable.com. Well, it was supposed to be a surprise and then and I accidentally saw the conformation email when I used our iPad. Under special occasion, he put ""Celebrating second anniversary"". I was excited because I knew most upscale restaurants that know this ahead of time treat the diners well and make them feel appreciated on their special day.

When we arrived, we were escorted to the tiniest table for two. Think Parisien style dining, except for the fact that we are not in Paris. I am petite so I was able to make due, but my tall, easy going husband was rather uncomfortable being scrunched up. The server saw us adjusting the table so my husband could squeeze in, but he did not seem to care. Oh well, this restaurant was completely packed so it must be spectacular so the discomfort is probably worth it.

Our server arrived and asked us if we were celebrating anything tonight. Apparently, he did not read the OpenTable.com memo. Not a problem, since he told us he was feeling overwhelmed and the restaurant was packed. We politely told him, it was our second anniversary. Second time, 15-20 minutes later, he comes around with our drinks and asks, ""What occasion are you celebrating again?"" 

He was inattentive with us and very distracted during our entire dining experience. Part of me felt bad for him because he was swamped, but the other part of me felt sightly irritated that we did not seem as important. For dessert, he made sure to tell us that we would only be given half of a brownie as complimentary and we would have to pay for the whole brownie...I've never had this happen at a high end restaurant. Most classy restaurants ask if you are interested in dessert and then they give you the dessert menu if you are and then write Happy Anniversary or Happy Birthday on the plate or if you are not, they still surprise you with a dessert compliments of the chef. I think his intentions were to be informative, but it just seemed tacky for this to be done at a supposedly high-end, upscale dining establishment.

Our three course dining experience took a total of two hours and fifteen minutes, which is a rather long time for a mediocre experience. Our server's lack of attention to detail was definitely the deal breaker for us. We had long finished our dessert were obviously waiting for our check while our server was chatting it up with other diners while we waited was unprofessional. The fact that the manager noticed our disdain and had to come over to collect our payment was irritating to say the least.  

Needless to say, we probably will not return here again. There are other upscale places in town that have comparable food quality, but with better service.",2013-03-10 20:35:09

It was nice: shredded buffalo chicken, hard boiled egg, avocado,  blue cheese, tomato, onion (cut really too thick), & I think maybe some bacon?  I found myself wishing it had croutons. The ranch seemed house made; I found it to be a little on the thick side but tasty. My husband got the pulled pork sandwich which we both thought was kind of run of the mill. It came with potato chips which were really good; kind of like a very tight, tiny waffle cut & dusted with what seemed to be a combo of bbq, sour cream,  & cheddar. We also got the country mac which had smoked sausage & bbq sauce. It was pretty good. I loved their noodles; large, thick elbow. Their sauce was pretty saucy but not super cheesy.

So on an attempt to go to Soho Sushi, which was closed on Sunday, my friend Melissa and I stumbled upon the next closest thing, which was Cheap next door. Had no clue what it was...in fact, I was a little nervous because the place is called Cheap. So when we sat down and were given our menus (after the manager graciously told us who are server would be and that he would be back to check later to see how everything was...and he did), after a quick glance, I realized we walked into a Tapas restaurant. Now...I usually HATE Tapas...I'm very much a creature of ""what's mine is mine and what's yours is yours"" when it comes to food, but we were sitting down already and I decided ""what the heck!"".

The menu was actually a very good mix of small plates: steaks, appetizers, seafood, cold foods, and sushi rolls. We ordered the Steak (w/ twice baked potato), springs rolls, goat cheese, and tuna roll. Heavens to Betsy...they were all phenomenal. The tuna roll I think was wraped in a thin piece of lettuce (for sure wasn't seaweed) and it was great! We asked for the spicy sauce on the side (my friend doesn't do spicy) and then it came with soy sauce (which I'm pretty sure had a hickory kick to it) and the other sauce that's has a slight, but delicious lemon taste to it. Steak came with an INCREDIBLE oil/herb sauce and the potato was incredible. Again, an amazing sauce with the spring rolls, and if you like warm goat cheese, then you'll be in your moment of zen. It's a big slab of warm goat cheese (sorry...just drooled...cleaning up). 

What else is phenomenal you ask? The red sangria, that's what! It has a perfect blend of sweetness and no harsh alcoholic after taste. Also, apparently it's happy hour from 5pm-7pm so the half pitcher of sangria (plenty for two people) is $7.50 instead of $15.00 (and their martinis are 50% off too). 

The creme brulee was pretty delicious as well. Our server, Jolita, couldn't have been sweeter. She was very attentive and was incredible and very helpful when we asked questions. 

Also...ambiance...hot. We sat outside, which was all grand because it's florida in February and you can eat outside here, but the inside was damn nifty. They had some great typical lounge music playing. However, the niftiest part was the use of car seats for the booths. It just seemed to fit. Also, the bathrooms have the funkiest sink (in a good way) I've ever seen. I felt like I was panning for gold. 

Okay...I think I need to stop. But, if you have a chance, PLEEEEEEAASE try this place out. It's been awhile since I've enjoyed a restaurant so much...and I might even be a tapas believer now.",2008-02-18 00:44:00

We ordered the mimosa special that mentioned a bottle to share and various juices, but when we ordered we were told you have to get and walk over to add juice to your mimosa. I'm sorry but I don't see why any customer would like this as compared to having small carafes sent to the table like most brunch spots do. Our waitress could have offered to Atl east bring our orange juice with our bottle but she just brought the bottle and glasses. I later asked for a carafe of OJ and we just used that instead of getting up for each new pour. 

The food...the big cinnamon roll they have was disappointing. For some reason they didn't have the apricot glaze and normal presentation but instead had chocolate in it? Thankfully we liked chocolate too lol. The actual roll was too airy for me for a quality cinnamon roll and the icing was way too light and tasted closer to whip cream than icing. The eggs Benedict I ordered was the best part of the meal however it took 2 tries by the cook. The first time my eggs Benedict came out with the eggs wayyy overdone. It's frustrating because too many times restaurants prejudge me and assume I want my eggs well done maybe because I'm black? We are not all alike. I like my eggs runny. I like my poached eggs POACHED. The manager at least did come out and apologize and confirm the 2nd dish was better and it was.

Let me start with I LOVE the concept of SweetArt. I have been going here for a little over a year and generally lip smacking love my food. The flavor and the spices just make me want more. However, I must admit that lately the food is very inconsistent and does not make my taste buds as happy as previously. Every time I leave I am frustrated with my restaurant experience that it affects my enjoyment of the food. The employees, nice and individual which I adore, need serious customer service training. It appears that they are just winging it every day and are in need of an experienced restaurant manager. The to go order process is always chaotic and there's no wait area so the customer is just in the way of dine in patrons. The employees are clueless on how to determine who placed an order and who is dining in - obviously the name system is not working try #s. The staff do not check on the customers - yes I would like another napkin. The employees do not always write down the full order on their order to the kitchen but certainly manage to correctly charge for all items which means there is a disconnect between the front staff and the kitchen staff and usually a missing or incorrect item in my bag. I would love to continue to patronize SweetArt and indulge in some of their goodness, I just don't have the patience - -  please work on customer service and consistent quality so I can get my vegan soul food on. 

My review from 03/2015
I LOVE Sweet Art, words cannot describe my feelings. The food is full of delicious favors that are beyond satisfying. This is a great spot for date, hang out with friends or dining solo.

I can't believe what a huge disappointment our dinner was. My wife and I walked out saying, ""for what we paid, we could of had an awesome meal at Little Fish for half the price!""

The good: 2 stars are warranted because the wines (3 glasses each) were not only delicious, but generous pours. We were also pleased with the service and the interaction with our server. The cheese plate was the best thing we had.

The bad: My wife is a pescetarian and I eat everything. We were told that they could accommodate her. Between the two of us, here is what we got: simple salad for her (dressing was light and very flavorful), a cheese dish that complimented the wine really well, roasted almonds, green beans (a little sour and waxy, we couldn't finish it), one prawn each, a small bowl of gritty mussels with a side of french fries in a mayo like dip, ""glorified"" tater tots with a cheese poured over them (I think they called it crispy potatoes), small clams (which were good) and desert. Soooooo, where was my meat? And where was the fish for either of us? For what we paid, that had to be the most pathetic chef tasting we ever experienced. Not one thing was that great.

As always, my wife and I will give most restaurants 2 chances. We are debating that rule after the huge let down at Tinto. My advice, don't do chef tasting, for the same price, we could have picked 3-4 items off the menu each.",2013-05-04 00:06:25

The other served dish at table of clam linguine was good. Waiter was not at all concerned when response to his question of how we'd enjoyed our meals,  was a reflection of the bad lasagna.

I opted for the Garlic Three Cheese Burger. It had a nice kick. For $9, it was pretty reasonably priced for the size of the burger and quality of the meat and cheese. One of the pros/cons, depending on how you look at it is that the burger is priced as is, no sides included. So if you normally don't eat the side, its nice and you aren't up charged, but if you do, it isn't bundled into the overall price.

First of all, let's get the basics out of the way: the gelato is really good, the service is swift, and the place is clean, bright, and delightful. The gelato isn't quite as good as at Pitango Gelato (our favorite in the DC area) but it's extremely good all the same. Their banana chocolate flavor is particularly excellent! So, based on the gelato, Capogiro gets 4 stars.

But it's rated higher in my estimation because, first, it has lots of seating, inside and out, and free wifi. Ice cream, coffee, and free wifi? If I could marry it, I'd be on my knee in half a second. The more romantic reason for rating it higher, though, is that the place is built on the site of an old Baskin Robbins at which yours truly worked for a summer when I was courting my beloved (my future wife, not Gold Medal Ribbon ice cream...though that rated very high in my affections at the time, too, because I essentially lived on the stuff, being a poorly-paid itinerant).

We ordered chips and salsa, and then 3 lunch taco combos (carne asada, fish, pork belly and cucumber salad, corn and rice and beans),

First off, the chips were like bottom of the basket chips (see pic), they were mainly broken pieces of chips and the whole chips that were there were almost stale. This wouldn't be and issue if the chips were free, but we're paying for the chips so....

The carne asada tacos were sad. The pork belly was alright. The only one I was really happy with was the fish taco.

The cucumber salad was meh. The rice and beans were average. I really liked the flavor of the corn, but it seemed over cooked, but not warm (weird).

There was nothing wrong per se: everything came out astonishingly fast and the service was top notch, but the food was mediocre. 

A little background: a few months ago I went to Bing Bing Dim Sum (their sister restaurant in Passyunk) and was absolutely blown away - easily in my top three favorite restaurants in Philly. I was so obsessed I googled more information about it and found this place. Now, Fishtown is quite a trek from where I live but I was determined to seek this place out because Bing Bing was just THAT good. 

We arrived at the tail end of happy hour and ordered four dishes, for $5 each: beef and kimchee dumplings, beet rangoon, black garlic wings, and the pastrami bing. I couldn't taste any kimchee in the dumplings and the beef was not seasoned well (they DID have a slight kick but no kimchee flavor detected at all). The dumpling skins were also kind of rubbery. Similarly for the rangoons, I could not taste any sort of beet, and the goat cheese was just too overwhelming. The accompanying sweet and sour sauce was, for lack of a better word, weird. 

The wings and pastrami bing were quite good, although I would probably not pay the regular menu price for either. The house red was Black Box, by the way. It's not that the food was pricey, but the taste/value for the price. 

I'm honestly a little sad, but maybe my expectations were too high? To be fair, we did not try any of the ramens which I think are more popular. I won't be coming back but might try out Cheu Noodle House (the third sister restaurant on 10th) sometime.",2018-01-28 23:10:10

The meatball appetizer is delish, very flavorful and really decent sized - came with 7-8 meatballs which surprised me.  The pizza is best shared for 2 unless you are a pretty good eater.

This is not the first time they were served to me like this. I thought last time it was an off day but again they were not crispy and could use more cooking. Minus another star. 

Those soggy potatoes were served with a homemade ketchup which was quite bland and required more seasoning and sugar. It was too bland for my liking. So minus another star. I also ordered a latte which was ok. But average at best again. My friends coffee was ok but refills were hard to come by as his coffee cup was empty most of our meal.

The decor was very ""different"". They had male and female white clothing hung up on the wall. Honestly, it gave me a sort of eerie vibe! The walls were painted with blue and white giving it a a cheery tone. So the entire restaurant gave out a combo of creepy and bright!

The dinner menu was pretty short and concise. It was difficult to even understand the types of pasta. Since the menu was not very interesting, nothing appetized us but we just ordered random dishes hoping it would turn out good! The waitress took forever to take our order. It looked like they were understaffed as the same person was waiting a very large party of people besides the other tables. 
The complimentary bread arrived a while after we were seated. It was so hard to chew.

The food arrived almost an hour and 15 min late. We had to ask what was taking so long. The waitress herself did not know what was the hold up. It was all disconnected. The SPICY CALAMARI arrived in a bed of arugula and goat cheese. It got soggy within minutes. Ended up leaving majority of the dish. The ""spiciness"" was just a bunch of jalapenos in the bottom which was probably contributing to the immediate sogginess. Meh.
Pasta dishes: TAGLIATELLE and OREICCIHETTE were a large enough quantity. We had requested the Tagliatelle to be made with alfredo sauce. It arrived in a very watered down sauce- almost like a soupy consistency. The Oreicchiette had broccoli rabe and ground fennel sausage. It was fairly good! [1 star]

We had an early dinner on Labor Day.  These weren't exactly their prime hours.  We were like 1 of  5 tables in the whole place.  But hey, the service was great.  We had a really pleasant waitress who hit all her cues and was very friendly.  Although El Gato wasn't busy, I could see how this restaurant would be good choice for a weekend night to grab chips and dip while having some cocktails.  They have a good space with a smattering of televisions, which are all tuned to sporting events.  I liked the setup.  

So the food.  Chips and dip were totally respectable.  I thought the salsa had a good flavor.  We supplemented with queso, which was excellent.  I'm not a big queso guy, but according to Shari V, this cheese was ""quite bueno"".  For the entree, we split the chicken and steak fajitas.  I thought they were decent.  As expected, the meats were served with all the fixin's.  Even though the fajitas were good, they didn't achieve that next level 4 star quality.  For starters, the meat was a bit underseasoned.  I tried dressing it up with some bell peppers and sauteed onions, but the lack of seasoning was kind of the theme for the entire fajita dish.  The flour tortillas were stale around the edges which I hate.  IMHO, decent flour tortillas are pretty easy to come by, and these didn't quite hit the decent mark.  

At any rate, El Gato Negro was a solid 3.  My fajitas were not a total hit, but there was plenty of potential.  I suspect we will repeat El Gato Negro.  The chips, salsa and queso were enough to bring me back in.  I saw they had some pulled pork tamales, which are on my radar.",2015-09-08 02:50:20

I guess it was a rather large piece so it was kinda overcooked. I had to drench it in syrup. The latke was nice and crispy.  My sister loved her dish.

People are hot and sassy with a penchant for incredible food, fine music, impromptu dancing and outdoor drinking.  Commander's Palace takes that incredible food to the next level, even for a town known for incredible food.  Dust off your jackets, boys and pull out the silks, ladies and head over for some high class, championship feasting!

The menu is upscale New Orleans with plenty of Cajun and Creole influences.  We started off with pre-dinner cocktails as our table was readied.  Before we polished the first round off, we were shown to a table and presented with the evening's menu.  I was impressed that the entrees ($34 - $44) include soup or salad and dessert.  That makes the dining experience a great deal (vs. my native NYC)!  My three dinner buddies all went for this deal, but given the incredible opulence of the appetizers, I settled on ordering three apps (1 as a starter and 2 as an entrée):

1. Soups 1-1-1 - A demi serving of three soups: Gumbo, Turtle & Soup du Jour ($8.50) - this was a great way to try all of the soups, especially the very famous turtle soup!  The waiter gave me a splash of sherry on top, and it was quite delicious.  The serving size was just right to try all the soups.

2. Oyster & Absinthe ""Dome"" - Plump oysters poached with bacon, artichokes, absinthe & double cream presented under a flaky French pastry ($10) - this was exactly as described and lavishly decadent.  The pastry dome was very fun (though a bit messy) to eat!

3. Foie Gras ""2"" Ways - Seared Grade ""A"" and a torchon of Hudson Valley foie gras with spring berry beignets, crushed pecan brittle, foie gras ganaché and blackberry jam ($18) - I think there was a special on that night where there was also a small glass of foie gras café du lait, which sounds strange, but the foie gras flavor was very mild and actually quite appealing!

All three of my appetizers were delightful, but that didn't stop me from doing some sample bartering around the table.  I managed to snag some Black Angus Filet Mignon ($39) (delicious, but you are better off trying the more unique items on the menu), some Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish ($34) (the fish was wonderful and the champagne poached lump crab topper was amazing!), and some goat cheese grits ($6.50) (one word - delicious) that we got for the table.

Although we were already bursting at the seams, we really couldn't pass up on a sweet finish.  We each ordered a dessert with the full intention of going family style armed with spoons and sugar lust:

4. Creole Bread Pudding Soufflé with warm whiskey cream ($8.50) - that warm whiskey cream was intoxicating...not sure the kiddies can order this stuff - yum!

5. Warm pecan pie and vanilla bean ice cream with melted chocolate, candied pecans & Fleur de Sel caramel sauce ($7.50) - although I only managed to snag two spoonfuls (because we had a pie hog at the table - you know who you are!), that was enough to cement this as one of the best pecan pies I've ever had.  All pecan pies should come with chocolate and caramel sauce!

6. Bananas Foster for two ~ a table side flambé of bananas with Caribbean rum, brown sugar, banana liqueur & vanilla bean ice cream ($14) - this is as good as the sum of it's parts, ice cream and sauteed bananas with sweet rum sauce.  However, the real enjoyment is in the table side fire and the general hush that decends on the restaurant as everyone looks on enraptured

7. French crème brulée with scorched local sugarcane and a Dixie Crystal ""fleur de lis"" ($7.50) - class crème brulee with attractive presentation

All in all, Commander's Palace was easily one of the more epic meals in my lifetime.  I highly recommend it!

We sat inside with full service, but still got a nice breeze from the open doors/windows nearby. Service was great and quick considering how packed it was. They had live music outside and even cornhole, it was obvious we weren't the only ones having a great time.

The reason I can't give it the fifth star is because the food. Granted, we both really enjoyed the smoked wings and brisket, but I found the pulled pork and sides to all be a little bland.

We had a 7:30 reservation, and we arrived about 5 minutes late. We checked in at the back with the hostess, as we expected to be led downstairs to the ""speakeasy"" restaurant experience. We were not seated until nearly 8PM, which frankly is unacceptable to me at such a proclaimed restaurant. If you can't manage the lapse between parties, you should really offer your customers a complimentary drink at the bar, at the least. It wasn't until my boyfriend re-introduced himself to one of the restaurant group managers (Bill of Schulson Collective) and reminded him of his experience at Sampan where he found shards of glass in his drink, that Bill immediately made a note in our reservation to offer us a complimentary round of not one-- but two champagne glasses per person. Bill, job well done. I just wonder if we would not only have been charged for the champagne requested to celebrate the birthday, but also would never have been offered anything as we waited 30 minutes to be seated.

The food was delectable. We opted to do the tasting as always seems to be the way to go at these restaurants - Harp & Crown, Sampan, Double Knot.

We ordered the following: the tuna to start, the salmon from specialty sashimi, shrimp taco, pastrami pork belly bao, lobster tail, duck bibimbap, Japanese scallop, bacon yakisoba, and lastly, the king salmon sashimi from the sushi menu. Everything was tasty. No complaints.

Visited them again today and the service was much better and I noticed a renovated interior and menu board.

I ordered the Elanaruz sandwich - turkey with guava preserves and cream cheese on pressed Cuban bread ($6.99).  Sounds good, right? Well, it would've been better if they had used less cream cheese. It was really overwhelming. I had to scrape a lot of it off but still, the taste and smell of the cream cheese overpowered the sandwich. If they had used more guava preserves, it would have had a better balance.The Cuban bread though had good flavor. So I recommend that if you order this, tell them to go light on the cream cheese. 

While waiting for 10-15 min for the sandwich to be made, I noticed an awkwardly placed sign that said the June special was buy 1, get 1 free on the cannolis. Sold! $2,50!  Not the best cannoli I've had...that title goes to Moreno Bakery...but it is decent. The shell was fried a little too much and overall,it was a little too sweet. But it satisfied my sweet tooth.

I'll return again soon to try another sandwich and pastry. Hopefully, it will be even better and I can bump them up to 4 stars.

She never brought bread. When our entrees arrived, we asked for bread. She said she had forgotten our bread and it got burnt in the oven. She bought us some later but we were mostly finished with our food by then. 

The salad was only okay. Our entree was not edible. 

First, it was so hot. I think the server had forgotten about our food, let it get cold, and then put the entire plate in the oven to be reheated. The first bite burnt my mouth. It was about ten minutes before we could eat the food without getting burnt. 

There was also a thick layer of salt on top of the food. I could not eat it. My dog did not seem to mind the salt but I could not eat it.

I had a lot of quality options growing up in the DC metro area. With that said, I've been to Ho Ho Choy on a few different occasions and it's probably one of the better options for Dim Sum on a scale of ""bad"" to ""just okay"".

Regarding the Dim Sum, nothing seemed to be fresh. Classic things like the Steamed Shrimp Dumplings (Ha Gow) were underwhelming because they weren't served at the right temperature. The Fried Taro Puffs are supposed to have a delicate and crispy outer shell filled with a flavorful taro and pork mixture... their version had a hard, crunchy shell with an under-seasoned and borderline dry filling. The turnip cakes were dense and lacking salt. Everything was generally a touch above room temperature which just isn't an enjoyable experience for Dim Sum.

Aside from the Dim Sum, I've come in with a few friends for Shabu Shabu, or Hot Pot. Think of it as Korean BBQ, but soup style. You select your broth, then meats and starch, then cook your food in your individual broth. There's also a nice condiments bar that has everything from soy sauce to cilantro to peanut sauce to build your own sauce concoctions to accompany your meat selections. My only criticism is that the broths can sometimes be lacking salt. Otherwise, it's great.

Overall, the service is okay and the Dim Sum is below average. But the Hot Pot is the best reason to visit here and probably the only place in Tampa to get it.",2013-02-12 18:32:04

I came, mostly, because I had a friend with me that has never been to New Orleans, and with the reputation WM's has established for themselves, many people feel the need to try it.

We get to WM's and even before we step out of our Uber, we are greeted by the line of people waiting for their turn to experience the culinary heaven that all the lore tells us we can expect.  We get in line and immediately get slapped in the face with one inescapable fact - it's hot.  It was REALLY hot, and the line was along the side of the building in the direct sun light.  After the first 10 minutes, other people in line are joking about abandoning the line for the cool air conditioned environment of an Uber that is 3 minutes and a finger tap away.  Another 10 minutes and those conversations became more serious.  Sure enough, people began to leave.  I look at my friend and he is quiet... and sweating.  I know he's quiet because he's hot, uncomfortable, and hungry.  All I could do is just hope that, when he eventually experiences their food, he'll forget the line that became more like a fight for survival.  

After a good 45 minutes in line waiting, AND watching groups that were in line behind us get in first because they were parties of 3 or 4 and we were just a party of two, we finally get into the restaurant (mind you, we had to partner up with the couple behind us and create a group of four to avoid being passed up AGAIN for a larger party).  I went with the fried chicken with butter beans, and my friend had the same except he went with the red beans and rice.  

Was it good?  Of course it was.  Was it the best fried chicken in New Orleans?  Well, with a whopping sample size of about 4, I can't really answer that question.  But I will offer this.  They have their own recipe with its own unique flavor profile.  It was amazingly moist and juicy but after the third piece, I couldn't help but notice that this is a bit on the salty side.  Again, not a good or bad thing, but not my personal favorite.  

I have heard on more than one occasion, as I'm sure many of you have, that WM's has ""the best fried chicken in New Orleans.""  But I've been confronted with the question, ""How do you measure that?""  Is there some scientifically measured goodness score that we can assign here?

So my friend ate in silence.  I didn't interrupt him.  I wanted him to soak it all in before I asked anything.  When he was done, he still didn't offer up much.  I know what he was thinking though, ""It was good, REALLY good in fact... but was it worth the line?  Was it worth the wait?""  Even though I have a limited experience with fried chicken in New Orleans, I'm forced to say no, it's not.  There are other offerings throughout the city with flavor profiles that I prefer over WM's and I won't have to wait and (literally) suffer in line to get it.",2016-09-10 21:33:28

The greenhouse is nice and very warm on a sunny day!  

It is pricey...I paid 20 for a burger with an egg on it.  18 and 2 for the egg.  It was well worth splurging on, a very well prepared fresh beef burger, cooked to your liking.

We had made reservations for 7:30pm on a Friday and the parking lot was packed! (We took that as a good sign). We stalked people to their car and finally found a spot around circling a few times. We were seated promptly and I got the chills from the buzz of the cozy atmosphere. 

For appetizers we got the crab bisque and grilled octopus (later to find out I claimed the last order of octopus for the night). The soup had a slight kick to it; but full of flavor with bits of fresh crabmeat. The grilled octopus was a little charred to my liking- but I've never actually had octopus prepared this way so who am I to judge. It was served with tart pickled vegetables and I loved them all to contrast the meat of the octopus.

For our entrees, I ordered the corn risotto with crispy bacon crumbs; and my boyfriend got the grilled pork with watermelon, mint, almonds. His pork was tender and cooked medium rare (a little undercooked for pork in his opinion). The water and melon was such a refreshing surprised and the almonds gave the dish a nice crunch.

My corn risotto, on the other hand, left me a lot to desire. The corn was sweet and crunchy, tossed in gloried rice. I don't know how they are able to get away with calling this dish a 'risotto' because it was under cooked and gummy at the same time. I had to push the 'crispy bacon crumbs' aside because they honestly tasted like 'bacon bits' from the bottle at shoprite. I think I could have made this dish better with my eyes closed; and I was so, so, so, disappointed. 

Anywho; dessert was chocolate buttercream cake and bread pudding.... and both were very dry.

I had driven by a million times but really never knew much about it. When I checked the menu, I kicked myself for not trying it sooner!

I ordered the jalapeno-cilantro wrap with quinoa, white meat chicken and avocado.  I thought for sure this would be super flavorful and full of delicious stuff that I love.  While it was good, it has potential to be so much better.  It was actually pretty bland. It could use a lot more of the jalapeno cilantro sauce (I mean, come on, that's what it's called, you should taste the jalapeno and cilantro...). The addition of quinoa, avocado and white meat chicken did come at an extra cost, but they were definitely worth it. 

I wanted to take some of their jalapeno-cilantro sauce and salsa for my chips to-go from their salsa bar, but there weren't any lids for the portion cups, so that wasn't an option.  

My food came out super fast and they have Diet Dr. Pepper, both very good things, in my opinion.

Cassis subtitles themselves  ""American Brasserie"".  I'd agree with the categorization.  They have achieved a nice upscale casual atmosphere.  Just what you'd expect from a brasserie - modern decor, tile floor, wood appointments, and a beautiful bar.  You feel like you are here to sip wine, cocktails, dine on great food, and have fun conversation.

The service was great.  Clearly the management knows what they're doing - no opening night jitters or any other issues.  Just smooth sailing.

The food was excellent.  From the Tuna Tartare and Caesar Salad to the Crispy Duck Leg Confit and Steak au Poivre, everything was spot-on.  Even the Mac and Cheese side was fabulous!  For desert, the Fresh Marinated Berries Napoleon was light, delicious and not over-sweet - a rarity these days.  Finally, Espresso and Cappuccinos hit the spot along with an after-dinner infusion:  Tequila with Jalapeno and Guava Juice.  

A brief bit about the cocktail, beer and wine menu: creative, carefully chosen and delicious.  It has everything from very unique infusions to an excellent draft beer list (including Chimay and Lindeman's Framboise - uncommon on draft), and a good wine list also (not extensive - but clearly well chosen).

They didn't have a cocktail or wine menu - when we asked what they had, we were told 'scotch..""  Fortunately, it turns out they did have rum also, so we all ended up with rum and (flat) diet coke. When we were leaving we saw someone with a colorful cocktail in a martini glass, so I am still wondering what connections they had in order to score a real drink.

We started with appetizers - I liked the papadum and chopped onions, the mango chutney was okay, and the naan, supposed to be stuffed with nuts and coconut, was odd. It had a pink interior, which caused us to question if the nuts were pink, or the coconut.

Dinner came quickly, with three bowls of rice for the four entrees. Here, there was mixed success. The butter chicken had plenty of chicken in a flavorful, but too thick sauce. My sechuan vegetable curry was just marginal, with not many vegetables, and I didn't really care for the sauce - spicy hot but not much flavor. My friend had the shrimp curry, and while the dish was delicious, it was extremely soupy, and contained only four or five small shrimp.

No dessert menu, even though they did have a few offerings that just didn't tempt us.

Our service was poor, but I'm hoping our server was new. For example,
Me: ""Are your 'pub chips' fries or chips? 
Server: ""Well, they're like potatoes...that are sliced..."" 
Me: ""Hmm... ok...""

She also described the 'shamrock sauce' as a ""spicy bistro sauce.""  Needless to say, ordering felt like a bit of a gamble!  I played it safe and went with the fish & chips.  (served to me without any napkins or silverware...come on, girl!) The fish was tasty and well battered.

When I first arrived at my job in Indianapolis, I was instantly told that I needed to go to Burgerhaus.  ""It's awesome"" was the common remark.  And sure enough, Burgerhaus is awesome -- but only in comparison to the (lack of) other options around.  For you see, there are more or less no other restaurants within easy walking distance that aren't (a) pizza, (b) hospital cafeterias, or (c) that outpost of greasy-spoon goodness known as Bearcats.  This means that Burgerhaus has the gourmet-ish market all to itself.

Unfortunately, I'm not exactly impressed.  Not with the food, not with the service, and not with the idiosyncratic hours that bear no resemblance to the hours they claim to have.  As others have said, I've come here at times they were supposed to be open, only to find that they were inexplixably closed.  Outside of their classic burger -- which is admittedly a decent pub-style burger -- I taste large amounts of blandness and pretentiousness throughout their extensive menu.  I've been left unserved for long periods of time, and I've also had my order completely misinterpreted.  Everything seems to come with an unwelcome side of rudeness.

Whenever I do come here -- and nowadays that's only when my work team is having a business lunch and we can't go anywhere else -- I've taken to eating salads.  And their salads are pretty good -- probably the best thing on their menu in fact.  But that in and of itself is a problem, isn't it?  They do, after all, have the word ""burger"" in their name.

This place is  TIIIIIIIINNNY!  Only a few tables and completely lacks any type of decoration/ambiance.  

I came here for lunch and ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box and the famous square sushi with salmon on top.  The bento box came with the typical stuff:  miso soup, salad (really good ginger dressing!), cali rolls, and a side of rice.  The chicken was nice and moist, however I would have liked a little more teriyaki sauce (I'm a sauce girl!). The square sushi was quite good--but quite overhyped.  It had fresh salmon and avocado on top with a tiny bit of eel inside and it was topped with eel and spicy sauce.  Tasty roll---but $15???? Perhaps if the portion size was bigger and there was a little more substance in the middle I could justify this price.  

The service was nice and friendly and the waiter even warmed my half drunken sake bottle :-)

All in all, a decent spot to try but I can think of a lot more places I would go for great sushi before I break the bank here.",2011-05-06 22:11:40

I've ordered the pad seuw at many Thai restaurants and this one wasn't my favorite. It was okay but the flavor of the sauce was potent and overpowering. I did, however, enjoy my fiancé's fried rice.

Portions seem really hearty - getting a small or half order of Spaetzle was quite a bit of noodles. They have some traditional German dishes and things like blood sausage if you're feeling adventurous. The food this last visit was all extremely salty. My fingers were swollen within 30 min of eating (but I am salt sensitive) and everyone else in my party commented on the saltiness as well. The carrot & parsnip salad was so salty I could barely taste the veggies. The Dunkel beer -Duke is an easy drinking darker beer that sits light enough to allow for a big meal. The back of the restaurant is now a separate restaurant - Half Liter - which was packed and a little chaotic. It has wide open garage doors and I think a few gnats/flies might have migrated into Liter Haus as a result. I do want to come back and try more food as a lot of things on the menu appeal. I think there's just a few kinks to work out still at this place. I was almost going to give 4 stars- but going to wait until I get to try it again to decide either way.,2019-05-26 23:21:13

I was still munching away with my chips and dip well after I finished my flan and my barely-touched enchilada. I know I'll be coming back, if only to have more of this.

The main salsa was okay. I saw the chunks of tomatoes, but they weren't freshly cut. I couldn't tell if it was a salsa cruda or a flash-cooked salsa.

I tried the Southwestern, based on another review that said to try this dish with the fried egg on top. And I like to try unusual combinations and I love huevos rancheros. Unfortunately, this dish wasn't up to my expectations. I stupidly ordered too quickly and forgot to specify my usual ""no beans, extra rice"". So, while I barely ate the tortilla and egg, the chicken was left alone. I ate up all the rice, but the refried beans were not touched (I don't think I was asked which kind I wanted, if there were a choice). And I don't know why a ""salad"" is included if it's barely more than just a garnish. It did contain a few jalapenos.

The sweet tea is fruity and I detected the noticeable ""crunch"" of undissolved sugar crystals when I stirred it with my straw. Not ordering that again. I prefer my sweet tea made from a simple syrup. Otherwise, it's just an iced tea with sugar added.

The flan was very rich -- just the way I liked it. Even I couldn't finish, and I never say no to flan. I hope to try the tres leches cake next visit. It was always one of my faves, and it will be interesting to see Chuy's version of this.

I wasn't too keen on the ""decorations"". I was seated next to a wall filled with random, old-timey portraits with just Spanish first names. I didn't get a chance to see the room with the more interesting ceiling.

Overall, it was okay for my first time at this chain. And after trying it, I don't really see a difference between Americanized Mexican and ""Tex-Mex"".  Perhaps all of the Americanized Mexican I've been eating has been Tex-Mex all of this time? I do envision myself going back to try the other dishes I know I would like, instead of being adventurous this time around.",2012-12-01 23:41:18

Hello - it's a CASINO. People are allowed to smoke there in Florida.
Hello - it's a CASINO. On weekends most tables will have high limits.
Hello - it's a CASINO. In Florida. Agreement with the state is to not give away free drinks since it is a Native American facility.
Hello - it's a CASINO. They are in the business to make money.

That all being said, I had a fun time here this past weekend celebrating Father's Day with my parents. Contrary to some of the previous reviews here this casino does offers some great comps based on your level of play and frequency of visits. That is how it is determined to whom gets what. My mom got free rooms for both of us, we were compted on all our meals, and even received a nice discount on the poolside cabana we booked for all day on Sunday. Make sure you join the players club and use your card on all slot and table games to build up your points. I have only been here a few times before and received mailings for free rooms, free slot dollars, and free meals already.

This casino is huge, tons of machines over multiple gaming rooms, and table games of blackjack, poker, and others. Table limits are in the $15-$50 range on weekends. Live band and DJ plays in the small bar/ lounge area up front by the check in desk. Mixed crowd of mostly older 20's up through seniors. There are a few bars to hang at. Gets crowded and jumping on weekends. 

The rooms are terrific. Nice size. Super comfy bed. Large flat screen TV. Great bathroom and toiletries. Tivoli stereo system. In-wall safe. Bath robes. Very clean. Cool decor. Rock star portraits on the walls. The whole casino and rooms are in the process of being outfitted for wifi in the next few months. Also has a nice little gym to get a workout in that is free to use if staying there. Spa services too.

The pool area is wonderful and chic. Long rectangular pool surrounded by tropical plants and trees, cabana's all around, bar area, hot tub, waterfall, waitress service all day, and lots of lounge chairs to kick back in. I partied all day Sunday with my dad for Father's Day there. We had a cool waitress who served us a lot of beers, bloody marys, and shots throughout the day. Nothing like hanging out in the cabana with cigars, cold beers, and the ball game on our flatscreen. Not to mention the fun people watching at poolside.

Had burger platters with fruit delivered to our cabana for lunch. Burgers here are pretty tasty with applewood smoked bacon. Large fruit cup in a large martini glass came with it. Also had dinner at the buffet. As most buffets go it has its pros and cons. Nothing special here but nothing too bad either. Reasonably priced, but line to get in can be long. Mom got a casino host to usher us right in - yes! Had breakfast at the Green Room which is their diner. Breakfast there is always good. Large farmers omelette with grits and an English muffin. Tasty coffee too. There is also a small food court to grab a quick bite, a steak house, and a sushi bar.

Staff and service is nice and attentive. Most I have come into contact with have been friendly. I thought the casino floor and bathrooms were pretty clean overall. Can get a bit smokey, but that can be expected at a casino. Rock music is playing all day, and there is a lot of music memorabilia to discover everywhere here. Slots can be tight but my mom won a good amount over the two days. Sometimes you just have to be lucky with what machines you play. Blackjack was fun and I broke even so nothing to complain about. The casino is bright and hopping. We all had a great time here. Is it Vegas or Atlantic City? No, but it does a good job as a gaming spot for the locals in the Tampa area and surrounding towns.

I sometimes crave the wasabi pea and pretzel combo they freshly scoop for you as a bar snack. I taunt my height fearing boyfriend by luring him on to the balconies with the promise (and truth) of some fantastic Philadelphia views.

XIX to me is more reputable as a bar than a restaurant despite my having dined here several times. I may do a separate update on the food with a different star rating but let's talk lounge.

The lounge is everything you've dreamed a swanky hotel bar could be. Located on the top floor of the Bellevue on Broad street the bar hosts a wonderful view of Philadelphia situated in a cozy and intimate space. There are several booths, overstuffed chairs, and a fireplace that is often glowing. You don't come here for a fancy cocktail menu, you come here to drink from the impressive bourbon and scotch selection.

Bar snacks tend to change fairly often and are reasonably priced considering the venue. The table service can be a bit slow and isn't nearly as friendly as the bar staff. To be fair I find this true with a lot of places. 

Take a date you enjoy snuggling with and settle in for a romantic evening. If you are looking for a more low key and private night do avoid XIX on the weekends as weddings will often clear out and stick around into the wee hours. If you're looking to do some post wedding crashing get dressed up and you'll have a blast!",2011-10-10 02:04:57

The place was absolutely packed, but luckily we were seated right away. The dining area is long, narrow, loud, and dark. It doesn't really make for a great intimate experience. We placed our order of regular and spicy soup dumplings as well as fried pork dumplings. We ended up waiting way longer than expected, due to the fact that they were actively wrapping more dumplings as the orders piled in. After about 30 minutes we finally had our order. The fried dumplings were haphazardly thrown in a place with no real care. The wrapper is dense, which would be okay if it was properly filled, but more than half of what was wrapped was air. Moving on to the soup dumplings, the broth is absolutely superb. It was sweet and bursting with umami, but again the dumpling itself was half a bite at best as there just wasn't enough filling and way too much wrapper. The spicy soup dumpling also offered great flavorful szechuan mala soup, but just did not have the meaty filling to give you a satisfying bite.

The decor is splendid; it's a truly beautiful space in a lovely neighborhood, and at night, the lights twinkling over Rittenhouse Square Park make a magical scene. On the evening we visited, the crowd was glamorous, international, and VERY well dressed -- we passed a guy in obviously custom-tailored white tie on the way in, and I've never seen as many Gucci handbags in one place as in Scarpetta's main dining room.

So it's very beautiful, and if you want a high-end romantic atmosphere, it's hard to do much better. At least on the night of our visit, Scarpetta looked and felt like being in a luxury perfume ad.

But if you're there to eat a meal of actual food, and you care about how that food tastes, I don't know that I'd recommend the place. It's fine, certainly. Everything is fine. Nothing is actually, memorably *bad.* It's just sort of bland and under-seasoned and not up to the standard of excellence that the surroundings (and price tag) suggest. There's no finesse to the cooking, and no real care shown for the ingredients.

That $22 ice-cream scoop of spaghetti comes in a very basic sauce with no special magic to explain its price tag. It doesn't have the depth of flavor that you'd find in a South Philly red gravy joint and it doesn't have the bright freshness you'd get at Kennett Square's Sovana Bistro. It's fine, but it's not actually *good.* For a single scoop of basic spaghetti at $22, that's not exactly a resounding recommendation.

The filet comes glossed with chicken jus. Why? It's perfectly acceptable jus, but a good filet shouldn't need that. A good filet, and at $42 I would *hope* that's a good filet, shouldn't need anything to stand out. But at Scarpetta it will come with a painted gloss of slightly sweet jus, which to my mind is something that typically gets used to cover substandard ingredients and/or preparation with a gloss of faux luxury. I'm not into it.

Everything we tried was about on that level. The bread was fine. The cocktails were fine. The desserts were fine. But for what it cost, and for the splendor of its setting, it was all decidedly underwhelming in context.

If you're there because you're staying in the hotel and it's too much trouble to walk across Rittenhouse to a place that serves actually good food, and money is completely meaningless to you, and you're there not to eat but just to be among the beautiful people, that's not a problem. If you're there because this is a special occasion and you've saved up time and money for a splurge, it could be really disappointing.",2018-04-04 23:23:27

What we ordered 
2-  Scarlet dumpling 
1 - cucumber salad with Thai basil and tofu 
1 - mapo tofu 

All vegetarian we really enjoyed it . Service was great and food came out in a nice pace . Dumplings first then the cucumber and the mapo tofu . 
Only thing I didn't like was Mopo Tofu comes with rice usually it comes side by side but yesterday they served over rice which was not really well presented . So whenever you order Mapo Tofu make sure to ask rice and tofu served separately.

The counters and displays were a mess, you could see beans and rice being over cooked, the pico de gallo looked pico-less! The staff making or prepping the orders looked like they would rather be some place else. I asked a question , nearly got my head  torn off  as if  I insulted you by asking for you to mix the guacamole. For this being a chain location I hope this isn't like this everywhere.

Team Baja you are not looking so fresh over here. More like "" BAAA HAAA "" with the sides looking  like its not the freshest of fresh !

My first visit I had ordered the ""Baja Taco"" ( steak ) with some chips and a cup of their smoky queso cheese.  The taco wasn't what I expected, I was looking for some kind of flavor, little kick to the taste buds with this. The cilantro tasted dried out.. no taste to it. The pico had run its course just not even a hint it being hot, almost like watered down. I had to add extra salsa to it just for me to notice anything. The steak ... well over cooked had a  leathery chew to it, I was afraid I was going to sprain my jaw, or pull something lol.

The only thing that saved it was that queso, that was good, nice kick to it with their chips. Why could they put this kind of effort into their tacos' or sides.

Second visit was the same outcome as the first, this time I went for one of their burritos, a ""Pork Diablo ' !  With a name like that you are hoping for some kind of fire alarm to go off in your taste buds. It was ok in the spice realm with a chipolte sauce they put on there with the pepper jack cheese. Everything else .. failed, can not even say mediocre for this. The Pork carnita was bland, no taste , too stringy , the black beans (option of black or pinto) over cooked which ruined the burrito as it came apart a third of the way. The rice was well over cooked which turned to a big brick of mush mixed with everything else, cilantro I could barely taste . Another disappointment on team Baja

So the 2 stars is for that queso and their salsa bar, the only thing that saved this. The staff the first time around wasn't the friendliest, maybe it was a bad day for them my first time. Cleanliness is sub par, they gotta stay on top of things with orders being made. I am not sure if I will stop in again , at least not for another few months.

My friend downed a few pints while I worked my way through the sampler. When I was ready to call it a night the employee returned to help me find an IPA to get in a crowler as a gift for a friend. His advice would up being spot on as the recipient of the crowler loved the choice.

The worker I spoke to knew exactly what was in each sandwich, which I liked since I have food allergies.

There were some issues, though.  It took over 15 minutes to get our food, so I can't recommend this place if you're in a hurry (unless you call ahead to order).  I also wasn't entirely happy with their drink selection; there were a lot of sugary sodas in their case.  They really bill themselves as a healthy restaurant option, so I personally would appreciate more organic beverages or fresh juices.  Finally, it was slightly pricey.  They charge $2 for garlic hummus if you want to add it on your sandwich.  I could understand $1, but $2 for a spread?  Doesn't seem right.

So come here for like center city sips or happy hour or because you're renting the room for your birthday and you've got money to drain. 

Here's my main BEEF with the sushi place. We asked what that happy hour specials were. The waitress told us that the happy hour specials were only for people sitting at the bar. I almost got up to walk the one foot over to the bar. Isn't that freakin' ridiculous?! HAPPY HOUR SHOULD BE FOR THE WHOLE RESTAURANT. Duh.

Five stars for being class-A d-bags. Is that too harsh? Yeah. You won't find this eloquent review in the city paper. But at least I'm being real, people.",2012-04-04 18:42:20

I was expecting a lot because of the pretty good reviews.  Maybe I am a harsh critic of good Chinese food.  Not to sound like a snob, but coming from N.Y. and living in L.A. for a time, my expectations are pretty high.  If you follow my reviews, you will know which is my favorite Chinese Restaurant.  I don't want to make comparisons because it is unfair.  Let me mention that the menu here is quite extensive.  We did only get a couple of dishes that are pretty standard.  Probably, when trying a new place I am a bit on the conservative side.  They do have Vietnamese, Filipino, Thai dishes that might well be terrific.  They have a unique pricing option.  You can order about 10 different standard dishes for $4.99. If you want soup, egg roll, fried or brown rice and a drink, for $6.99 you get the combo meal which includes everything. .  You order at the front counter and they bring your dishes to your table.  I ordered the hot and sour soup which came with some really good kind of Chinese noodles and duck sauce.  Soup was just fair.  I had the vegetable lo mein.  It was a huge plateful.  I'd say it was fair.  Lots of vegetables.  It came fairly warm when it was served but very quickly got cold.  Strange.  Hubby ordered honey chicken which came with a small egg roll, fried rice.  The rice was so bland.  The egg roll tasteless.  Honey chicken was unremarkable.  We came in on a Saturday at 5.30PM.  Not one customer came in.  The lady who took our order was very pleasant.  I am not happy with giving this 2 stars, but because I am honest I feel I have to.  Albeit, we did not try any other dishes which might be really good.  If you are just looking for a quick fast food atmosphere then this place might fit the bill.  P.S. The place is spotlessly clean.",2013-11-17 01:17:01

Finally in June 2015, my wife and I met friends for some light food and drinks.  It was very nice and now is on my list of places to visit if I ever write that Indy travel guide!

The restaurant is quaint and cozy.  It is locally owned by ""Joe"" who lives close by and always seems happy to talk with his customers.  They are kid friendly.  The kids menu even has an option to ask for additional plates and let your kids eat off your plate.  The children will get a pack of crayons and coloring pages to keep them busy while waiting. 

For the food: We've had a variety of dishes here.  I love the fish tacos.  My wife was talking with the owner about the tacos and said she wants to try them sometime with chicken.  He said, ""we can do that now if you want.""  So, she had them with chicken and loved them!  There are a number of pork dishes and a number of mac & cheese dishes.  The spicy pork bbq in mac and cheese was very good.  The kids pizza is a good size.  Our kids could split one (although they haven't yet - dad seems to find something to do with the left over pizza :) Burgers are great.  We always get the beer cheese pretzels - hot pretzels with beer cheese dip!

Drink: there are excellent mixed drinks. See the photos for some of the offerings. Also the local beer selection is wide and accommodating.  

Other: The bathrooms are very clean and updated.  Again, they are also kid friendly with changing tables.  My wife checked it out and added that there are even clean diapers in the bathroom - nice touch!

FBtM has great outdoor seating.  You will see this right when you walk up.  There are some seats close to an outdoor fire place if it is a chilly night and you want to sit outside.  We did this once on a family visit.  If you are sitting outside during the sunset, the seats on the west will get a short period where you cannot block the sun (it only lasts a bit until the sun is behind trees - still, sit with your back to the west and act surprised and concerned when the other people in your group pull out their dark sunglasses).

The location is in Broad Ripple down a side street and close to the Monon.  Great location! They have a parking lot - not enough for everyone dining there to have a spot, but there is free and pay street parking close by.  I have not every had a problem finding a free place to park.

The place is very wonderfully decorated with interesting light fixtures and old timey photos on the wall. We all said it was cute the second we walked in. The waiter explained everything and was very personable and helpful. 
For food starters, I tried the olives which were very nice and the cheese board which was beautifully plated. I never found out what the 3 cheeses were- my guess would be a goat cheese, a blue cheese, and some sort of hard cheese. Either way they were all delicious and could be paired with apple slices, cherry compote, honey, and some little crunchy things. The only weird thing was that it came with large slices of soft bread. I would have preferred some crackers or small crostini, but it was still delicious. For our main I split a pizza. It was the specialty pizza of the night- porchatta, long hots, and a fried egg. It was nice. It could have used a little salt and pepper, but it had a nice crust. The long hots were super spicy. 
The rest of the party ordered a variety of dishes- octopus, scallops, halibut, pasta, etc. Everyone enjoyed their meal. 
A strange occurrence throughout the evening was that they kept bringing doubles of our food and other things we didn't order. I'm sure that this is just a thing that they will need to iron out in their first couple of weeks. 
We tried a couple of cocktails and the draft beers/cider and all were good.

There was a consistent line while I was there but it moved quickly and the food was prepared fast. The truck served hotdogs, fried pickles, and canned beer. But these were not your typical backyard hotdogs. There were about 10 different ""gormet"" combinations to choose from. I ordered the Mackinac, which had chili, cheese, onions, and macaroni salad. It was delicious but probably one of the safer options. I also got to taste the California Uber Alles, which was a california roll-type hotdog (if you could even imagine that). It had ginger, avacado, cucumber, soy sauce, and wasabi mustard. Tasted even better than the real thing! We shared the fried pickles too, which came out in a huge portion. When I've orded these before they are usually pretty spicey. These were very mild, which I enjoyed because I don't like spicey foods. The atmosphere was great and the crowd was very friendly.

The management/food runner duo tossed our plates down and ran without a word. When we got the second (red/blondish headed) to stop in her heels she looked at us like we were nuts for asking for the water we had already requested twice- and even more nuts for requesting tartar and cocktail sauce for our shrimp.

Our sundae was ... bad and almost nauseatingly sweet. They gave chocolate and vanilla scoops topped with marshmallow and offered with sides of white chocolate and whipped cream.

If ranch-themed cuisine is your thing, definitely check it out. If not, what are you doing here? 

The number of ranch flavors is overwhelming, so here's our top 10 (out of the 10 that we tried)

10 Asian Zing - Sweet and sour. Not so great. 
9 Red Billy Goat - Kind of a let down.
8 Southwest - A little spicy. Not the best
7 Curry Yogurt - Surprisingly refreshing.
6 Kemowasabi - Pretty good. A little heat.
5 Jack the Ripper - Mild. Okay.
4 Twisted Ranch Original - Solid ranch
3 Cheesy Bacon - Tastes like fake processed bacon. Still delicious.
2 Parmesan Peppercorn - Almost makes you think this restaurant was a good idea.
1 Jalapeno Popper - This one's the winner. Not too spicy. Nice cream cheese flavor.

The surprise highlight of the restaurant was the bloody mary. Get their ranch-infused bloody mary. It might have been the best we've ever had

And it turns out they serve other food too. 

Fries - Great! Solid ranch delivering system.

Loaded tots - Pretty good. They're tots. I've never not liked tots.

Side Salad - They don't have non-ranch dressing. They're really committing here.

Potato Salad - meh

Big Kid Mac n' Cheese - Actually really, really good

Cool ranch croquettes - These are great. Get them with the parmesan peppercorn. Thank us later.

Buffalo Chicken Flatbread - The blue cheese flavor was too much.

Twisted burger - It's fine. That's it.

If you're not a ranch-head, it's basically just decent bar food. This was the first restaurant we reviewed on our podcast, so it'll always hold a special place in our hearts. But we're never going back.",2020-01-17 23:03:34

We came recently for a concert and decided to pregame and grab some food beforehand. We walked up to the hostess stand in the main area and asked for a booth for 4 people. They wouldn't seat us since 1 member of our party wasn't there yet.. even though there was literally nobody waiting for a table and multiple tables were open. They finally sat us at a table but refused to sit us in a booth. Not quite sure why that is their policy. 

The menu is mostly appetizers and sandwiches/burgers. We ordered nachos for the table as well as cheesesteak egg rolls and a buffalo chicken flatbread. The nachos came out first and were horrible. The cheese was the fake nacho cheese used at sports games but it was cold! Who puts cold cheese on nachos? It's almost criminal. The rest of the stuff on the nachos was pretty weak as well so we sent them back and ordered the tots instead. I feel bad sending back things but they were honestly awful. The tots came out with the same gross cheese but they were actually better since the tots were warm, so it warmed up the cheese. The cheesesteak egg rolls were delicious and the flatbread was tasty as well.

Service was pretty bad and we had to ask for our server multiple times for the check, water, drinks, etc. Maybe our waiter was mad that we sent back the nachos but we were still planning on tipping well, so he could have tried a little harder.

Dessert came with the buffet so we split some mango ice cream and gulab juman. the juman tasted like donuts soaked in honey, and the ice cream was fresh and fruity. we also got some incredibly fresh tea that really hit the spot on this cold day.

New Delhi is definitely worth checking out whether you do the buffet or enjoy a meal. you get ultra fast service, a full stocked bar, and they even make party trays and deliver to nearby locations (sorry Old City and South Philly).

Calmari stuffed with crabmeat appetizer - When I was looking over the apps I saw this and the price tag of only $8 I was quite intrigued as this item goes for much more everywhere else and said, ""Ok, I will play this game let's see what this is all about"". Well, it is literally one tube of Calamari which yields five bites. Not bad but I felt like it was a tease much like most of the dates I go on. That being said this item is listed under NIBBLES on the menu, they aren't kidding (good but too small a portion bottom line).

10oz Steak w/  Chumichurri sauce, fingerling potatoes,asparagus -  This was one of there specials for the day and honestly there was nothing wrong with it but when I go out and order steak I want it to be at the level where it is not something I feel I can easily make at home. I would not order this item here and obviously you should order seafood at a seafood restaurant rule number one.

Artic Char with Bok Choy and Lobster mashed pototoes - The waitress explained the fish to be not Salmon but the offspring if the papa fish was a Trout and the mama fish was a Salmon you would have the outcome of Artic Char. Well, I do not recall ever ordering this before so I split this with a friend and again it was alright. This may sound werid but this next sentence perfectly sums up my experience with this dish. After grabbing one or two bites of it I was not enthusiastic about picking up my fork to have more bites of it but forced myself to do so as we were splitting the bill lol. The Lobster mashed pototoes were great though of the two spoonfuls I had.

For wine it is BYOB and this restaurant is CASH ONLY. I am glad I got to check this restaurant off my list of places to try as I always wondered how the food is there walking by it.

Its like they gave me all the ""waste parts"" and thought I wouldn't notice under the mounds of cheese and tomato. I rarely waste food but I barely ate any of it.

My last experience was difficult to park and the fries were overdone (about 6 months ago) And we were hit up for money by a homeless guy on  our way into the casino.

Today I took my mother here. I remembered the parking issue so we parked by China Diner and decided to walk up a few blocks. We passed seas of homeless people and were nearly knocked over by a guy so drunk he wasn't sure of his own direction. Not the casino or restaurant's fault but businesses can make an impact on their surroundings and enforce certain criteria. 

We arrived unscathed to the diner. I was behind 1 lady and waited 5 minutes for the guy, Eric to take her order. Then he went back and did some other things and helped us a couple minutes later. The 2 cooks did not help him at the register. I figured this would all wash with the great food. I am patient...

He took our order somewhat curtly which I kept simple. 3 meals at about $50 total. He brought us cokes that tasted like there was a cleaning chemical so strongly that I had to spit it out and he said ""Oh the carbonation is a little off, should have warned you"" Really?? Why would you serve it? And that was CHEMICAL not carb! So he gave us the worst tea I have tried in my life. Definitely downhill on this...But maybe the food will be alright??

So we got our order and the cooks were nice and handed it to us and told me where my double was. Awesome! Then we got home...The burgers have lost some of their charm. The lettuce seemed old and rubbery which I would have attributed to travel but the fries were under fried and yet soggy!!? How does one do that? The flavor that used to draw me to them was also lackluster. 

Save your money and visit In N Out or something. Get a burger that won't (as I am worried about as I write this) make you sick and fries you will like. You also won't have parking and bum issues. And your waiter will not try to poison your drink. 

Jesus Christ! Management overhaul this shit before someone dies! I will NEVER be back. I will mourn the loss of an old great.",2017-08-18 20:47:21

Enough with the sandwich, I think you all get my point. It was good, but not the best. But, the service the other day was horrendous. Meaning it took us two hours to eat lunch.

I made the mistake (maybe it was good fortune) to come here during the playoffs when it was super busy.  The hostess asked if my party of 5 had reservations, and I sort of laughed because THIS IS A SPORTS BAR RIGHT?  Nope!  Turns out it was super busy and we ended up waiting for about a half hour.  

However, it was worth the wait.  We ordered the spinach dip and the chips with salsa and queso for apps.  Both of these were delicious!  We scarfed them up and washed 'em down with a bucket of beer- perfect football watchin' food.  Their menu features a lot of burgers, so those were our go-to choices.  

My burger was delicious, and cooked perfectly.  It was a standard burger done right.  My boyfriend's veggie burger was also good (according to him, I was too busy eating the real deal to sample a fake burger patty).

LA Jackson was introduced to Nashville with a lot of hype and fanfare -- and it lives up to all of it. If Urban Cowboy Public House is Nashville by way of NYC, LA Jackson brings the City of Angels to the Music City in a way that makes sense and is authentic to the changing nature of the city (and the vibe of the neighborhood in which it sits). I loved it.

The first thing I noticed once stepping off the elevators onto the roof level of the Thompson Hotel was... Biggie?? 'Is that Biggie?' Yes. Yes it was. On Mondays, LA Jackson has a DJ and he spun all sorts of '90s hip hop and R&B. I was stunned. Rarely have I been out in Nashville to hear this soundtrack. I hope they stay with it. It instantly put me in a party mood -- which was appropriate given the setting. The view is everything you've read it to be. With nearly 360 degrees of Nashville landscape, come here at night to appreciate just how far our fair city has come in the last five years and do your best to identify all the various areas (I had no idea the Charlotte Corridor had some many tall buildings). Don't be content to just peer out from the indoor windows. Go outside, take in the patios (there are heaters; you'll be fine) and really look around. 

You seat yourself at LA Jackson, so I advise to come at off hours. The place is already slammed. Our waitress informed us that Fridays and Saturdays are already filled way past capacity. There's that LA thing. I don't do crowds these days so I am more than fine with coming here on off hours/days. If being seen is your thing, prepare for a wait. The word is out and it's just going to get harder and harder to take part in the fun. My friend and I posted up at a window-adjacent two top and got right to business: ordering drinks. The cocktail program is significant but not stuffy. What the libations may lack in innovation (to some), they more than make up with taste, execution and presentation. Both of our drinks were beautiful and tasted even better than they looked. I opted for the Barataria Fix. This was a gorgeous gin creation served in a goblet and adorned with floating citrus. The brilliant mix of strega (color), absinthe (punch), Pear (sweetness), sage (depth), orange bitters (just 'cause), and Prosecco (fun) was one of my favorite combinations in some time. I couldn't stop drinking it. My friend's Buddy Bolton was a smoky/subtly sweet vodka drink. I enjoyed tasting it but I couldn't sacrifice my Barataria Fix. I shall stick with that drink for as long as it's on the menu. Since we didn't have time for a proper meal, we shared some Tennessee Truffle Fries to accompany our beverages. You can rarely go wrong with truffle oil, fries and parmesan. These will satisfy quite nicely. You will pay LA prices (drinks, fries, tax, and tip ran me $50) but that should be expected. LA Jackson is very LA but it's the good kind of LA. It had a high bar to hurdle and it's done so with feet to spare.",2016-12-01 18:44:19

The food menu was really convoluted and difficult to understand to order from at a glance. Weird and stressful organization which took me a long time to figure out.

The shrimp, chicken and pork tacos were something I couldn't even make and mess up on my own at home. I can't describe it, but the flavors were all wrong and offensive. The salsa bar was just ok. The guacamole was flavorless...no seasoning and no punch. More like a floppy fish handshake. Ew..

The parking lot is not small, yet it seemed to be overflowing on my last visit for a Thursday happy hour. 

While the booths felt big and open they also were not very private. There was a family nearby so I had to be careful to watch my language. I snacked on stuffed olives and deviled eggs. Did not get a full meal. Drank a tall Budweiser, and overall had fun with friends. I do prefer sports bars with a less corporate feel, something more like Ferg's is downtown St. Pete. The menu did look fascinating, and while the food was not too expensive, it did seem a bit pricy for being bar food.

Overall this is a decent sport bar and everything was A-OK. My snacks were good, service was a tad bit slow, but understandable with how crowded it was. Not going to be chompin' at the bit to come back, but I would not object to giving this place another shot!",2014-01-18 18:39:57

I was a little put off by the pricing, it does seem like a bit much for small cups or cones of ice cream.  Still, its very good, and its an adventure mixing flavors.

My friend ordered some skewers and a $3 Sapporo which is their special on Tuesdays. The server was very soft-spoken and timid.

The skewers weren't even good and I did not finish them. Having been a server myself, I did not ask the server to change my order because I hate being the ""difficult"" customer, even when the restaurant is wrong. When we received the bill, the Sapporo was charged $7 instead of $3. Again, we let it slide. When we received the check back, a waiter dropped a sauce bowl of Sriracha to our table. A table with no food, people putting jackets on, and a check and someone drops sauce to the wrong table? How is that possible?

First, I'm not keen on the decor.  The homey decor seemed out of place in the converted Art Deco building lobby.  

Second, the prices for the wines by the glass are outrageous - a glass costs twice as much as a bottle goes for retail!  

Third - while the entree portion was quite substantial - the food was hit or miss.  The brioche amuse buche was  good, but the pumpkin butter, a nod to the season, was off and detracted from the delicate and warm bun.  I'm not sure there were oysters in the oysters and pickles appetizer.  I certainly know there was a lot of fried breading, with some lightly picked cauliflower, onions and beets.  The duck in mole included both a leg and breast portions.  The duck was expertly prepared and the mole interesting.  The Brussels Sprouts were these tiny little marble sized cabbages that were hard and bitter.

Because they were so light and airy you could eat the whole batch of five and not feel like a heavy pit in your stomach as you would after eating cheesy bread from a pizza place. 

Pastels- I was super excited about these. You can order beef or cheese. I went with the beef option since I was getting cheese bread. Maybe that was the wrong bet. Inside there was beef, parsley and tomato that I could tell. The meat really lacked salt so it was particularly bland. A bit disappointing. I would think the cheese filled one would be better. 

The sandwiches looks great here and I saw a handful of people ordering them so I think that's the move at this place.",2021-02-01 14:51:10

I didn't fall in love with the food here. Everything was pretty average. 

My favorite part of the entire meal was probably the complimentary fresh biscuits. Soft, moist and delectable warm fresh biscuits with a honey butter to pair with -- it was a perfect combination of savory and sweet to start my meal off with. After that, it went on a downward slope. For appetizers: The butternut squash soup was pretty good but comparable to any other vegetable soup from other restaurants. The crab cake was delicious. My partner and I both ordered the 8 oz filet and mashed potatoes for our main entree. It was nice and red on the inside, but the outside was dry and over cooked. There wasn't much flavor to it, nor was it juicy enough. The waitress notified me that's how the kitchen makes their medium rare steaks -- very red on the inside but dark on the outside. I can see why people compare the steaks here to an Outback Steakhouse steak. For dessert, we ordered the lemon tart and blood orange sorbet. Both were extremely sour and tart as expected. I was a little underwhelmed by the blood orange sorbet. It was 3 tiny balls in a glass. 

The atmosphere here is very unique. Definitely an old Hollywood vibe with super dim lighting. Comfortable seating all around. 

Although the food was pretty mediocre, the service was great. I had multiple people check up on me, consistently fill my water and overall very friendly service. Very quick too -- the courses came out in perfect timing, it was as if there were constant eyes to see when we finished the last bite of each dish.",2018-01-22 21:13:45

That was my experience with Tibby's.  I went in with my pals who had been there before, and I love crawfish so I ordered up a fried crawfish po'boy sandwich.  And because I wanted a bit of variety, I also ordered a side of the andouille and cheddar grits.  One of my friends ordered the muffuleta, cut off a portion for me, and that was really tasty.  I really liked it.  My food?

There are lighter sorts of batter for food, and heavier sorts of batter.  And if you've had a bit of battered food, you know there's a taste to the heavier batter when it's cooked in a fryer that's at a very high temperature.  That's how my crawfish were prepared, and because it was that heavier sort of batter cooked quite hot, the taste of the crawfish was lost completely.  That, and it didn't hurt that the po'boy was swimming in the remoulade rather than as the menu offers, ""tossed"".  On trying the andouille and cheddar grits, I was surprised because the grits I was served up was quite different than any I'd ever had.  I was expecting something much heavier, and what I got was nearly like a souffle.  Had I know, I would have never ordered it, as the texture wasn't to my liking.

Now, I'm not saying that I don't want to give them another chance, because my friends had been there a few times and they always seemed to have good experiences.  I'll just avoid anything fried or the grits next time.",2017-03-31 08:53:00

For one person the best cheese steak is where the meat isn't chopped up much at all or is still a whole slab, for another, the finer it is chopped up the better. One cheese steak purist will insist that it can only have cheese wiz on it, while another aficionado is disgusted by the florescent orange goop and must have American cheese. For the record, I fall into the latter on both categories.

I've had Jim's steaks and others from within the city and I'm convinced that more often than not it's the mom and pop joints in the strip malls out in the suburbs that tend to make the meanest cheese steak. There are a few places in Philly and just outside the city limits that know how to make a great cheese steak IMO, but Jim's isn't one of them.

Is a Jim's cheese steak good? Yeah it's good. Is it great? Not by a long shot - though it's arguably the best of the cheese steak tourist traps. I think what pains me most about the high profile establishments like Jim's, Pat's and Geno's is that when people visit from out of town they are invariably going to be drawn to one of the big name places for their ""official"" cheese steak experience. With the cheese steak being to the Philly region what Po Boys are to Louisiana, that to me is a culinary tragedy.  So it doesn't surprise me that places like Jim's Steaks are peppered with reviews from out of towners making statements like, ""what the heck are you people in Pennsylvania eating!?!""",2010-11-18 18:50:00

My friends each ordered a plate of scallop, and a plate of beef. I ordered the Toro beef with shio white soy and New York strip steak in miso. Both cuts of meat were good but I wasn't really a fan of the marinades that I got. The side of sesame oil with sea salt I ordered, along with the table condiments, did not help the beef. I ended up using the cod caviar sauce from my French fries. The sausage fried rice bibimbap we got to share was pretty tasty but it came after we bbq'd. 

We ended our dinner with three orders of the green tea mille crepe. The portions are huge! We ended up taking our cakes home, but they were delicious along with the ice cream.

It was about $50 per person for one cocktail, one appetizer, two plates of bbq protein, one dessert, and a rice to share. Overall, the food was good but a bit pricey.

From the snooty hostesses that informed me that I could not be seated until my party was ready (they were finishing cigarettes outside) I could tell this place was not going to entrance me. 

We opted to sit at the bar as the hanging wicker chairs did not appear to be made for men of our stature. Plummeting to the ground and being struck on the head by some bolt pulled loose may give some visions of workmen's comp, but not me, thanks!

Yeah, the look is kitschy in that 1960's jetson's sort of way. The tang astronaut cocktail was well received by one of my friends, and the Bacon Bloody Mary was something I predicted a while back and have been surprised to see show up so slowly. Too spicy for some, and of course if you ask them to make one not as spicy all you get is a blank stare and 'It's pre-made'. Wow! Way to be a bartender! If I ask for something beyond a shot and beer will your head freaking explode?

Actually, that might be more exciting than anything else served here that's for sure.

The bathrooms have large mirrors that act as one way glass so you can see IN to the bathrooms. Now, not being a shy type I personally didn't mind, but in this age of cell cameras everywhere this does seem creepy. I understand Starr loves the whole 'shared bathroom we're all adults' concept, but wow.

The other concept that goes quickly downhill is the beaded metal curtain behind the urinals. It provides a modicum of privacy as you're 'occupied' but then you walk through it to get to the sink. Ok, now follow my hospital trained cross contamination train of thought here. Drunk dude goes in, whips it out, sprinkles everywhere, turns, USES HANDS TO MOVE BEADED CURTAIN, etc. You now have to walk through said baptized curtain to get to the urinals. Yes, Bleah, now you understand why I was skeeved out by it versus 'wow isn't that cool'. And don't even try to tell me they have someone who cleans it. No star employee gets paid enough to stand there and wipe a damn bead curtain down with Lysol.

Unfortunately, the service here leaves something to be desired. I always have to remind the servers of missing entrees, and it is clear that they are drastically understaffed. The last time I tried to come here, they actually locked the door to prevent more customers from coming in!

Our meal started with the Meatballs, more specifically a place with two gigantic meatballs and a generous dollop of ricotta cheese. As an Italian person myself, I'm hesitant to order meatballs while out to dinner. These were fine, lots of garlic and a pretty decent gravy. My favorite aspect of this dish was the ricotta. 

For our main dishes, I had the Cacio e Pepe and my boyfriend had the Spicy Crab. Both of our pasta dishes were delicious. Though the price point was on the higher side in my opinion for an average portioned pasta dish. I think the best portion for price is the Chicken Parm.

We ended our meal with a round of drinks. I tried the Carina Sangria, a red sangria with berries. My boyfriend had the Negroni. Both very standard drinks that tasted great. My only complaint is that the berries were very mushy at the bottom of my glass and did not taste great when they came up through the straw. I had to made a conscious effort to avoid getting any berry remnants in my straw.

The burgers and fries were as good as Company Burger tonight. Mmmm. 

Now the shake game was off point. My son had a strawberry shake, I had wedding cake and my daughter had plain vanilla. The wedding cake didn't have nearly enough almond flavoring as it needed. It was weak and tasted more like a glorified soft serve dish. I like soft serve, but I don't go around paying $5.48 (with tax) for it. My son also said his strawberry was weak. Maybe they just didn't put enough flavoring. My daughter said her vanilla shake was good, but I'm a bit suspicious of her 11-year-old palate sometimes. 

It was good overall.",2018-08-08 02:36:24

We each had the cheesy potato soup which started good but got old pretty quick; this was a bigger deal for my bowl than my companion's cup. It was really more of a puree, which I think you should say up front, but either way, it was nourishing.

My companion had the ham stack, which was delightful, and I had the local beef slider. Now, I'll note here that was I surprised by the portions, because the ""small"" order was in fact *a* slider. On the other hand, that slider was delicious, and purely by chance I got there during happy hour, so that slider only cost $3.

Server was friendly, host was friendly, they had some weird honey/lavender cider on tap that I didn't love but I enjoyed trying, and I'll likely go again. So why four stars?

Friends love dim sum, but every dim sum experience--regardless of the city and the restaurant--has left me cold.  But I decided to try it again here in Philly.

The pork dumplings were a favorite, as was another unknown dish that had some sort of green leafy vegetable as a main ingredient, all wrapped in a ball and cooked in front of us.

Unlike other places, the staff here were friendly and helpful, telling us what the dishes were.  My other dim sum experiences have involved merely pointing at a dish and trying to guess what it was as I ate it.  That can be fun, but sometimes it's nice to be told what to expect.

Prices were reasonable, too.  Oh, and rather than stand in a long line, you can just head downstairs to the basement where there is usually no wait!  It's the same stuff, as far as I can tell.

Though this review is spotty, I've eaten here before hence the high rating. Our parties' numbers kept changing throughout the reservation process but we had solidified that it would only be 5 of us prior to arrival. We waited in the host/piano area for the others to show. Many of the waiters seemed to be confused about the number in our party because at one point we were offered to be sat after the cocktail waitress had brought drink menus. Once she saw we were standing, she assumed as much as I would that we were going to our table. Then, they found out it was 5 people, not 3 so we were asked to wait 10 more minutes. The cocktail server had already cleared the beverage napkins because again-she thought we were moving to our table. Finally we decided we would just order drinks so we placed our orders, only to be sat immediately after that. Felt bad for that cocktail server chasing us all over the restaurant. We were sat in a room I've never had the pleasure of dining in. Great atmosphere, but good Lord is that place cramped in there! Pretty much every time one of us had to use the bathroom or go out for a smoke break, all of us would have to move. We ordered appetizers while waiting for our last guest and served a lagniappe of mozzarella, tomato and basil bruschetta. Delicious! Our appetizers were served just as our last guest arrived. We tried just about every appetizer available, ravioli, escargot, paneed oysters, meatballs and a softshell crab.

Next we ordered entrees at which point a few of us requested additional drinks. All of the drinks except for mine were served. I waited patiently until seeing our server where I hinted at the fact that my drink was not delivered. It arrived promptly after that. For entrees we ordered the Osso Bucco which was on special for the day. It was served with the cocktail fork so as to remove the succulent marrow from the veal bone, but the birthday girl who had ordered this entree was not provided a dinner fork. My entree, the airline duck breast with pomegranate demi glace never made it to the table. I told everyone else to start as I figured it was probably sitting in the window and would arrive soon. Our waiter stopped by after the girls began eating to ask ""what am I missing?"" We told him we were missing the duck and he rushed off. These things happen in a restaurant, things fall through the cracks--and when they do it's always to the same person. That's how restaurant Murphy's law works. The chef served my dish in person saying that they wanted to get it just perfect for me. However, the grapes and apples they used as a garnish were flaming hot meaning it was slowly cooking under the heat lamp. Also the edges of the plate had not been wiped clean making it look rushed--and a little dirty. Despite this, the duck was savory and tender and the sweet potato mash that accompanied was delish. 

Following entrees all of us were far too stuffed to even think about dessert, but being that our server was a regular customer of our birthday girl, he served a complimentary banana foster bread pudding with vanilla ice cream with a candle and the whole dining room sang to her! She normally doesn't go for that kind of thing, but the fact that the whole dining room sung it's heart out made it that much worthwhile.

Had a few problems with the bill, some of the complimentary items were not removed from the bill at presentation, but were fixed promptly. This restaurant really is a must--the food is outstanding and like many places sometimes they hit, and sometimes they miss--no hard feelings with Irene's, we're all human.",2011-07-29 21:21:49

My crew and I had just finished a half-marathon and we loaded into Daily Eats for a late breakfast (I think fancy people call that brunch?). All the vegetarians (and there were quite a few) in the group ordered the same thing and were served a meal that included meat. When this was pointed out to the waitress she was not very remorseful and did nothing to fix the situation. We left the restaurant with such a bad taste in our mouths (literally) that most of us did not (and have not) considered returning to Daily Eats.

Fast forward to present. J-Fur and I are in the South Howard area early for a doctor's appointment. After it was completed, our toddler started rumbling and grumbling about being hungry. We got all ninja like with our phone and pulled up Yelp to see what kind of breakfast/brunch scene South Howard had to offer. Daily Eats was both highly rated and real close by. We decided to give them another shot. 

Since it was a weekday and still pretty early, we were seated and served quickly. J-Fur did one of Daily Eat's create your own omelettes with a side of potatoes while our daughter wanted some pancakes with a side of potatoes. I scoured the menu for any type of vegan option and was sorely disappointed to find that almost everything had cheese or eggs in it. I decided to make my own breakfast sandwich featuring an English muffin, guacamole and vegan chili.

The vegan chili was awesome. It had a slight bit of heat to it and was packed full of quinoa. The pairing of guacamole, vegan chili and English muffin made me forget all about that other failed visit to Daily Eats. I found myself stealing breakfast potatoes from J-Fur's plate. These little puffs were soft, with crispy pieces floating throughout. They were flavorful without the super grease of most breakfast potatoes. My wife enjoyed her omelette (hello, she should, she built it) and my daughter was more than ok with her pancakes.

The Fancy donuts run you at $2 each , and the regular donuts at $1.25. May seem "" steep"" but take a bite and you won't regret it. The regular donuts are made fresh to order, so mine was still hot, fluffy and such a nice density batter. Lightly sugared.. I'm drooling as I think about it.

The blueberry mascarpone is so good. It's like eating a cheesecake donut.. I can't even handle it right now. My keyboard is sticky as I'm typing because I just can't stop eating in between sentences.

Nadeen's can get crowded so it's important to factor that into your planning. The parking lot gets crowded and Arby's tows so you may need to drive around the block for parking - I think you can also park at the tobacco shop next door but check with the hostess.

You can order a margarita for $11 or a pitcher for $44, which gives you 6 drinks. My fiancé and I split one pitcher and that's all we needed before going club dancing afterward. They were STRONG and for $44, that's a deal compared to $10-15 individual drinks you would buy elsewhere. We ordered the Perfecto margarita pitcher with Patron Silver tequila (so yes, it ran us closer to $60 for the pitcher, still worth it). Delicious, strong, and no driving afterward!

The guacamole options are amazing! We opted for the De La Hoya guac served in a molcajete with white onion, roasted garlic, and basil. We ate it all and wanted more! We are picky guac eaters having grown up in OK and TX, and this is our favorite guac in Philly! The chips were salty and delicious too...similar to Tostitos, but way better!

The food is good too, it's just that the drinks and guac alone make it worth the visit. We were surprised that they don't make fajitas, which is our usual order. They focus on tacos and enchiladas with a few meat/seafood entrees. 

The Oxtail Enchiladas were delicious and served in a hot skillet with a side of rice and black beans. My fiancé enjoyed his trio of tacos. The portions are not large compared to traditional Mexican restaurants, but if you order an appetizer, like guac, you will be plenty full (and we like to eat a lot).

The bathrooms are downstairs, which can be tricky with heels on and a few drinks down. :)

We had a 10:30pm reservation on a Saturday, and it was packed when we arrived in both the dining areas and bar! It's definitely a vibrant scene and fun place to hang out. It was the only time left using Open Table a few days before, but worked well with our post dinner plans anyways. 

If you want a normal dinner time, I suggest planning a week in advance minimum! If you have a group of 4+, request one of the big velvet booths!

There is no valet, but a couple of parking garages are available within two blocks for those not using Uber/taxis.

I highly recommend it for a fun time and great Mexican food/drinks. It's perfect for date night or out with friends!",2016-01-31 22:22:44

I was also disturbed by the ungrammatical (and sometimes misspelled) Italian that was used on the coasters, the servers shirts, and the menu -- it's like they stuck it in Google translate and said, ""good enough!""

I was also annoyed by the envelopes our silverware came in - our server admitted that they are often used only once or twice: unnecessarily ungreen.  And then the napkins... They were dishrags (what my Sicilian grandmother would have called a ""moppina"") that, I hope, had been antiqued.  By the end of dinner, everyone had white fuzzies all over the place from the cheap napkins.

So, the food... one of my friends had the crudo di carne of the day, which was very good.  Someone else had the pretzel bites with beer-cheese, which was also good (but not a reason to go to a restaurant).  I had the ""involtini del muratore"" (which means ""bricklayer's involtini"" - literally, the food that belongs to the bricklayer and someone stole to put on my plate -- as opposed to ""involtini AL muratore"" - in the style of food a bricklayer might eat... but I digress).  This was recommended by the server, and consisted of cheese wrapped in mortadella, which was breaded and fried.  It wasn't greasy at all, which was great, but kind of just tasted like a mozzarella stick - I think another type of cheese would have made the flavor of the mortadella come out. 

I then had the ""bolognese"" poutine.  I have no idea what was supposed to be bolognese about it... it was just poutine - some French fries, nondescript gravy, and rubbery, flavorless mozzarella ""curds.""  On the top was a small amount of  ground meat, which was described as the incredibly pretentious sounding ""guinea hen leg meat,"" but might as well have been ground pork.  Again, it was ok, but definitely not worth the calories.  

A fellow raved about the maple fried chicken, and my partner seemed to like his pork pot pie.  I tasted it, and it was ok, but I wouldn't want more than a bite.

Dessert was decent - I had what the menu called ""fiordilatte"" soft serve (instead of ""fior di latte"") ""drowned"" in a raspberry lambic.  Think an adult version of a root beer float.

All in all, I was underwhelmed and a little scared at how much weight I may have gained from dinner.  I'm not going to be rushing back to this place, but I won't avoid it, either.",2012-03-05 18:53:35

They are serving a full menu. Time to check back in!

The basic concept remains unchanged: an eclectic, global menu that changes by day, starting with vegan staples, but with some modicum of separately cooked non-vegan items on the menu in the name of inclusivity to all diets. Their signature bowl 'o food is the foundation of most any world cuisine: usually rice and beans of some sort with some fairly creative preparation. The spicy red curry I got upon this return visit was a very tasty example. The best thing I'd ever had from them pre-inferno was a pesto tofu salad with pickled peppers. Once they had goat cheese ice cream. You never know what you're getting; it'll be a different flavor every time but usually a good one.

The rebuilt space doesn't look all that different, though the shiny new furniture stands out. It's a basic counter service model with indoor and outdoor seating.

IT IS RUN/OWNED BY A BIGOTED, RACIST PIECE OF HUMAN FILTH.

First I'll discuss THAT...then the food.

Geno's is notorious because a short while ago owner Joey Vento posted up signs that said he would refuse to provide service to people who ordered in any language other than English. It said """"This is America. When ordering please speak English."" 

A discrimination complaint was filed with the city of Philadelphia and Vento defended his racist, discriminatory policy in court. He claims he has a problem with the current immigration situation in the United States, and that his sign was an issue of free speech. He's right, of course; he can SAY whatever he wants as long as he doesn't actually deny customers because they speak a foreign language, or treat them badly because of it.

However his sign belies a deeper problem: Joey Vento believes that if your first language is anything other than English, you aren't an ""American."" He believes that real Americans speak English. This is both ignorant and false, and coming from the son of Italian immigrants it makes it doubly offensive.

Vento is PROUD of his racist hate message. He distributes pens from that say ""Proud to be an American""; next to this is a photo of him smiling and pointing at a sign that says ""Management reserves the right to refuse service.""

Guess what, Mr. Vento? That old chestnut ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason...""? It's an old wives' tale. There are lots of reasons why it is COMPLETELY ILLEGAL to refuse service to someone, and their race is one of them - along with gender, religion, political view and many more.

There are plenty of reasons not to eat at Geno's Steaks in Philadelphia; another good reason is that the food tastes like horsecrap. It is truly a tourist cesspool that draws people in with big neon signs; I live three blocks away and frequently I have to detour around another block when going out to run errands because the line at Geno's runs around the corner.

The bottom line is, if you eat at Geno's, in addition to getting food that tastes like it was crapped onto a plate for your enjoyment, you are also supporting a filthy racist bigot.",2008-06-07 12:12:34

Wood fried oyster roast- INCREDIBLE!!!! That's all. I wanted to eat 5 more of these plates.
Fried boudin- Ok; flavors were  really good but they were fried too long so they were slightly too oily.
Smoked pork ribs- Ick, these were terrible. They were swimming in their own grease and were chewy and not at all tender (and my family owns BBQ joints)
Pork cheeks-These were delish!! The meat was so tender and the flavors were incredible!
Mushroom salad- Yummy, but the dried lemon slices were extremely bitter, so I had to pick them out of the salad before I finished.
This is where the yumminess stopped, in my opinion. The cochon was the best entree, but it wasn't nearly as good as I had expected it to be. It seemed like glorified pulled pork to me. The brisket was not very good; the meat was really tough and chewy, but the horseradish potato salad was pretty good. I had a chicken dish which was extremely overcooked, oily and dry, and the accompaniments (minted peas and other veggies) were cold.

 My friend got the sam adams pot, As others have said the lobster and crab from the pot was wayyy over cooked and had apparently been sitting in water too long. For those who never had seafood like this it is not good! She also asked if she could have the sausage replaced by potatoes. The server said yes and when she got her pot there was one little red potato about the size of a half dollar, one. The server said he would bring out more, they never showed up to our table. 
He brought the waters out and we asked for straws. He forgot to bring them out until we reminded him twice. 
 I ordered the Redfish Orleans. It came out with cream sauce over fish next to a pile of ""dirty"" rice. There was supposed to be crawfish, shrimp and andouille sausage on top... None of that was present! I asked the waiter about it and he said yeah it's supposed to be on there but you got the end of the sauce. I just looked at him and he didn't think anything was wrong... I said I was unhappy with that and he said yeah your right let me take it back and get the right sauce. It came back out 5 min later and all they did was dump some of the cream sauce off of my plate and put about three slices of andouille on it that were about the size of a quarter cut in half and 2 mini shrimp. At that point I just accepted the plate so I could just be done and get out of there. The fish and rice where no longer hot at that point. I ended up mixing everything into the rice to eat it.

This particular location has had some high turnover rates over the past few years, but with nearby National Mechanics taking over, perhaps Lucha Cartel will have better luck. The decor is eclectically Mexican with Dia de los Muertos masks and luchador masks all around.

As a sister restaurant, they seem to use the same glassware as National Mechanics. And to satiate your spice needs, they've got several varieties of hot sauce on offer, including El Yucateco. 

Guacamole [$9]

We started off with the guac, which was creamy and had some queso fresco tossed on top. Still, it lacked flavor - I could not taste the lime or salt at all. A huge disc of fried tortilla was on top to offer some differing textures from the fresh-made chips. 

Lucha Nachos [$10] + Chicken [$4]
Chips, jalapenos, monterey jack, chihuahua cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, crema

The GF went with the chicken nachos. This was hefty and easily fed all of us. Fresh tortilla chips provided the foundation for cheese, jalapenos, pico de gallo, and guac. Not bad if you're looking for an app to share with some drinks.

Chorizo Burger [$11]
Chorizo, angus beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, queso frito, avocado, pickle, fries

I went with the chorizo burger, which surprisingly wasn't overly greasy. There was a nice hit of salt from the queso and creaminess from the avocado. Still, the burger could have been juicier and I felt like something was missing. The accompanying fries were decent, but could have been crispier.

Overall, there are better Mexican offerings in the city - whether you're looking for in South Philly, Fairmount, or in Midtown Village. But if you're in Old City and you're craving some margs, nachos, and guac, Lucha Cartel has got you covered.",2014-12-26 18:55:17

There is so much that is great about Hard Rock poker: The size of the room, the ability to game select because they do so much volume, and the lighting and comfort of the chairs are all excellent. It's one of the few places in the Southeast that can get a 2-5 PLO or a 5-10-20 Hold 'Em on a weeknight. Plus the average player skill-wise varies between bad and mentally incompetent to stand trial, so you'll never find a softer field at the lower limits. And recently they've made an effort on some promotions that have some value. This July 20 hours of play between Sunday and Thursday in a week will get you a $150 gas card, which is a very sweet deal by any standard.

But there are so many places where they could improve I don't know where to begin. The rake is 10% up to $5, plus a $1 drop for the jackpot even without a flop. And that jackpot pays for quad 10's or better cracked, with pairs only in your hand if playing quads, and both hole cards working if playing a straight flush... so, ya know, simple (riiiiight). But hey, enjoy the $500 for a royal, because that'll totally make up for it.

The quality of the dealers varies as widely as you'll see anywhere, as there are some I wouldn't let deal Go Fish at my kitchen table, and others that would be fine in Bobby's Room. The same goes for the floor: some get every call right, and others do things like say ""well I don't know who wins, so we're gonna roll this pot over to the next hand."" And yes, that actually happened. The comps also stink (0.60 an hour for 1-2 and below, $1 per for 2-5 and higher), and as in the rest of the casino, the booze is by purchase only. 

Plus they are full of silly and pointless rules like you can't sit backwards in your chair unless you're getting a massage from one of their massage girls. And you can't get your first buy in from the table, but rather must use the cage. You also can't buy the button. And the silly betting line is 100% live and any chips that cross are considered action, even if they're in your hand and you're cutting your bet. Which is just inane. 

A lot of the staff remains from when you weren't allowed to wager more than $2 on any street (yes, it was $2-$2 limit Hold 'Em, it was like watching paint dry), and they still treat the room the same way despite the fact the stakes and play has increased exponentially. There are so many people that don't understand how a major poker room can and should promote the game, as well as treat players. However this is the only option if you want to play 24 hours a day in Tampa (the dog and horse tracks are forced by state law to close 6 hours a day), and they've pumped a ton of money into the facility. It should be one of the best places in the country to play, on par with The Bike, Borgata, or The Venetian. But they continue not to get it, even though it is better than it was just a year or two ago.

So come for the marshmallowy soft play, which is by far the room's biggest draw for a seasoned gambler, but don't expect the same perks or treatment you should be used to if you play with any regularity. As of now, the Hard Rock continues to be all hat, no cowboy.",2011-07-19 21:47:51

The crawfish etouffee was average.  The crawfish at gratin  was super rich (too much for our liking).  I was disappointed, as it felt like something a chain restaurant would serve, yet we wanted authentic.  The service was less than stellar.  Had to constantly wait.  Maybe an off night, perhaps?

I feel like there are way too many good locally owned restaurants out there to be wasting time at chain places. However, my wife and I were given a gift card to McCormick & Schmick's so we decided to give it a shot. While we weren't completely disappointed, we were not entirely impressed either. 

Our meal was very good. My wife had the Chilled Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and the Lump Crab Cakes, which were delicious. I had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was awesome and the Top Sirloin, which was cooked perfectly and was very good. 

The problems we had however were with the service. We arrived at 6:30 on a weeknight and it took over two hours for us to complete our meal. Several other couples arrived after us, ate their meals and left before we were eating our entrees. Now, I am not a fan of being rushed and I understand that places can be busy, but 20-30 minutes between drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert is a bit ridiculous. Also, we had to repeatedly ask for drinks to be refilled and to check on our food. A side dish was also left off of my wife's meal. Again, some mistakes can be expected and I don't expect perfection, but for a place that bills itself as an upscale steak and seafood restaurant, we were not too impressed.",2012-03-26 20:46:17

The hanger still in the Accessible stall. Paper towels all over the place & stall out of tissue. I'm perplexed because it wasn't the end of a super busy night it was 3pm. 

Service was horrific. Cody was so engaged with another table he totally failed to connect with ours. We were 1 of his 2 tables and it took him 20 minutes and a reminder to bring my dining companion a straw. I ordered black bean soup quick arrived with sour cream (not indicated on menu). I advised Cody I did not want dairy and he stated the soup itself also has cream in it. OK scratch that...I asked about several other items to no avail. All the while he never made any suggestions.

My friend ordered soup, finished it and we sat a while before he even came back to check if I had decided, if I needed help, if he could speak with the chef to possibly accommodate my diet but noooooooooooo... None of that happened. I'd been to Brio many times over the years and bread was always served with vinegar & oil. For some reason none was brought out today, I payed particular attention because I was sitting blank faced as my friend consumed her soup. Something was missing!

Fast forward I expressed my concerns with Cody, requested bread & ordered the Insalata Della Casa salad sans cheese. The arugula, fresh greens & tomatoes seemed appealing. Cody stated bread is only brought after soup & salad. LIES! Thete is no better time to bring the bread sir. 

Salad arrived....dry, sad, dead. Lacking all life & greenery. It was a bag of iceberg junk salad mix with carrots & radiccio. 1 sprig of friseé & 2 buried arugula leaves. 

I couldn't take it anymore. I called Cody over, expressed my final words of disappointment & asked that he'd bring  the check. He apologized, returned with a salad to go & advised not to worry about the check. 

Other red flags included a cook wearing gloves wipe his forehead and drinking a beverage on the line. I observed a manager engaging with the staff so I opted not to alert him about what was obvious. Not even the hostess was welcoming; no hello, no smile, no thank you. This was a pathetic dining experience. 

I simply will not return to Brio.

The ambiance and decor matches Armature Works, in which the restaurant resides. There's a great outdoor seating area, (although it was too hot to sit out there mid-afternoon in the Florida heat). We sat at a high top by the window and enjoyed the water view and people watching. 
The service was impeccable and I wish I could remember our server's name. He was knowledgeable, professional and friendly! Honestly, it's the best service I've received anywhere in a long time. It was refreshing and only made our experience better!
For lunch, we shared buffalo cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and a steak sandwich. The cauliflower was smoky and delicious and a different take on the popular appetizer. The brussels were full of flavor and had a little crisp to them. The steak sandwich was tasty, but my half had a lot of marbleization or gristle.

The owner was very friendly and let us sit wherever we liked. The first thing you notice is the decor. It feels very tired, almost like your grandmother's living room. I'm all for unpretentious fine dining, but this was a little too uninspired for me.

We started the meal with an order of mussels and then each ordered the tasting menu. The mussels were good, but forgettable. The first course of the tasting menu was prosciutto with fig and arugula. I'm not a huge fig fan myself, but was impressed by the dish. The ingredients were all very fresh (almost too fresh considering the very small worm on one of the arugula leaves, maybe they can wash them a little better before serving them). The second course was a pea soup, which was very nicely spiced and satisfying. The main course was halibut with potatoes over a creamy citrus sauce. The sauce was very refreshing and complemented the fish really nicely. However, the halibut was overcooked, somewhere around medium-well. This seems pretty unforgivable for a place as nice as Downey's, especially considering there weren't that many people there to cause any chaos in the kitchen. After looking past the temperature of the fish, the dish was very enjoyable. For the last course, each person is given a choice from the dessert cart. I chose a slice of the raspberry millefeuille, which was absolutely delicious; I would go back just to have that again. The dessert was also served with coffee or tea, included in the tasting menu.

When we were brought the check, it showed us as being charged for the desserts, which were part of the tasting menu, but the waitress was quick to fix the error. Despite any shortcomings, it's probably one of the best meals you can have in the Santa Barbara area, and very reasonably priced at $55 each for the four course tasting menu.

And quack it all... it really was!

The restaurant is situated in a cute neighborhood about two miles from the city center. It's quaint and peaceful with great outdoor seating on a nice day. Fortunately we came during a warm November afternoon, so lunch outside was a must.

We started off with two appetizers- Smothered Fries ($10) topped with aioli, pulled pork, and cheese on top, and the Crab Cakes ($10) topped with jalapeño cream corn and a side of greens. The shoestring cut fries were amazing and the balance of sauce and spuds was great. Crab cakes were small but also delicious. It broke apart in our forks and combined with the cream corn was to die for

My friend ordered the Duck Burger ($15) which was juicy and amazing. Admittedly it was better than he Tri-Tip Sandwich ($11), which was also really good. If you like it tender, take advantage of the BBQ sauces that they provide with your meal. It'll kick it up a notch!

Pricing wise the food is a little higher than what you'd normally find. However, drinks here are cheaper than why I've found in the city. My $6 Bourbon and Coke was an all around favorite of mine as I indulged in all the great BBQ goodness in front of us.

Service here was also wonderful! I see mixed reviews about the service, but our server Jen was nothing but helpful and sweet to us. She took great care of our lunch date and I appreciate her for that!

Willa Jean is located in the Central Business District, within easy walking distance of the French Quarter and just a couple blocks from the street car line. The interior is clean, modern, with a hint of a retro classic vibe - with a little tongue in cheek à la NOLA style (see the bathroom doors you'll catch the drift). The natural light pouring through the windows was perfect for an early or midday meal.

Onto the important part, the noms.

After eating here, I felt I had been personally blessed by the food Gods. Absolutely everything was incredible. The staff was kind, attentive, and knowledgeable. We came in on a Wednesday morning before noon. The restaurant was fairly busy, but we were seated promptly. It was a bit later than originally planned, as I had intended to try their breakfast menu. No regrets getting to order from the lunch menu though! 

We tried:

Butter it up and Jam it Biscuit - $4 - different from any biscuit I've had elsewhere. It was somewhat of a hybrid between a traditional biscuit and the inside of a croissant. It didn't taste like a croissant, but it had the flaky layered quality akin to one. Mmm-mm, buttery carb goodness. The house made jam it was served with was the bomb dot com and super addictive. Worth trying!

NOLA-Style BBQ Shrimp Tartine - $16 - I was a little hesitant ordering this, because I'm not big on BBQ and definitely averse to smokey flavors. Our waitress vouched for this choice as I was waffling between a few items on the menu. Thankfully, I went for this and never looked back. The shrimp were plump, juicy, and cooked to perfection and served on top of a thick slice of delicious sourdough. The BBQ sauce, more of a gravy, was unique in an utterly delightful way. Creamy, without being heavy, the slightest hint of heat with a creole seasoning essence. This dish floored me in that the textures and flavors combined amounted to so much more than I imagined it could be.

Riddled Meatloaf Sandwich - $13 - Best. Meatloaf. Ever. So tender. So flavorful. It just melts in your mouth. 

I think it's every foodie's concern with the bougie kind of places to question the dose for your dollar. Fancier the food, the smaller the plate - pretty much the status quo. However, Willa Jean offers you the 5 star experience without the stuck-up attitude, unjustifiable price tag, and empty stomach to show for it. We were beyond sated and satisfied at the end of our meal. We even managed to spot, executive chef and owner, Kelly Fields. Again, thank you Food Gods, for the foodie celeb sighting.

Don't let the heat of The Big Easy keep you from topping yourself off with the scrum-diddly-umptious peanut butter hot chocolate! It's beyond worth it for all the PB-aholics like myself. The perfect ending to a fantastical meal.

Whenever I have to chance to come back to the city, first thing I'll do is high tail it to Willa Jean.",2017-05-31 21:11:38

BJ's is running a special for all their pizzas 7 days/week, so while picking up a burger at Red Robin next door, ordered by phone an Italian Market pizza for hubs. Normally, it costs about $18, got it for $9, which is more appropriately priced because I've had other flatbread/thin crust pizza that's smaller for a similar price, a couple bucks less, during Happy Hour. If it were regular price, I think I'd have a hard time paying that much knowing the pizza is really only enough to feed one person. They added the right amount of meat that included pepperoni, meatball & ham. 

The only recommendation I have is to please give customers accurate times for Take-Out. I called my order in at 12:55pm & didn't leave until 1:30pm. When I'm quoted 15-20 min. I'd like to pickup my burger next door at relatively the same time, so one meal isn't comprised as a result.

It was a nice night and we thought it would be fun to eat outside by the river.  Unfortunately, the outside patio is quite small and about half the tables are cocktail size, making for a tight dining experience.  The patio is also located pretty much right at at an intersection with no buffer between it and the road .  Bottom Line: Lots of road noise, cramped space, and not much of a river view.  Oh well, I'd come mostly for the food, right?  Well, that wasn't too great either.  Had we stopped after the cheese plate and the Disco Frites (an interpretation of poutain), this review would probably be three stars.  But we pressed on to the main course and were pretty disappointed with what we got, especially considering the price.  It's a shame really because you can tell that they're trying to do the whole farm to table, New American, simple dishes done well, but they just aren't pulling it off.  Case in point, the cheese plate: they know they should have one, but the servers don't really know what they're presenting and the plate is full of boxed crackers, albeit of varying brands, and accompaniments that don't particularly pair.  For the main course I had the short ribs and my husband had the crab cakes.  He said the crab cakes just seemed mushy and that he found multiple shell pieces in them.  He thought the crab may have been prepackaged.  I found the short ribs to be pretty flavorless and wasn't too impressed with the wilted escarole they were served over (just didn't seem to add anything to the dish) or the accompanying potatoes, which were very dried out and kind of struck me as being reused after having set in a brunch chafing dish all day.  I notice that there is quite a disparity in the reviews and my best guess is that this place is somewhat of a local tradition and that the high price tag goes unnoticed by a lot of the fairly affluent, many retired people who seem to frequent the place.

This week has been a heat wave for the Chester county area however for a restaurant of this scale we didn't expect to have any concerns.  As a result, we booked a table to celebrate a birthday of a close friend and introduce them to a restaurant we've always raved about.  Upon entering we were in trouble as I'm not a fan of dining in uncomfortable temperatures.  The dining area thermostat read 84 degrees not even considering the humidity factor.  There was ONE box fan on the floor to move air with no success.  The temperature was a comedic topic to patrons about how uncomfortable it was with sweat beyond brows and running down backs.  The woman next to us asked the waiter to put cold water and ice on a napkin which was then placed on her neck.  I was hoping for another human to walk by to create a brief instance of wind and for once glad I was in traffic flow areas.

In summary, the food was amazing as always but the owners should be ashamed not to find interim solutions to mitigate this issue.  We expressed the check as soon as entrees were done to get out ruining a great meal and opportunity to catch up with friends and celebrate!  

This wasn't the first day of the heat wave and the manager's comment to our table is that they've called the HVAC company to add more freon.  There are portable air conditioners that could have been rented or purchased then to be penny wise and pound foolish.

We ordered the gumbo, jambalaya, chargrilled oysters and fried fish platter. So the chargrilled oysters are very good - amazing taste, with the butter and garlic sauce. The gumbo was great but needed Tabasco. Seafood platter of fried shrimp and fish was medium - it tasted good but not sure it was anything special. Miss Pam was our server and did a great job - complete sweetheart. Generally I would recommend it but not during the evenings - just to get a taste of the chargrilled oysters - never tasted anything like it!",2019-11-10 04:41:46

The setup is that of a diner, though the entranceway is extremely small and gets backed up when people are waiting to be seated and people are paying their checks simultaneously.

I ordered a western omelette with cheese and decaff coffee. The waitress poured my coffee right away, but a refill took a while. My omelette unfortunately took a while. The omelette came out with some wheat toast and potatoes. The omelette was pretty decent size but unremarkable taste-wise. The potatoes were neither hash browned nor home fries. They were barely cooked. It reminded me more of poatoes au gratin, without the sauce. Blech.

The only real saving grace of this place besides being open 24hrs, its that you really can see some interesting people. To my left was a guy with a tears tattoo who talked in a Donald Duck voice at a whisper. To my right, a off duty cabbie who was talking to a guido looking construction worker. I thought I saw a gang on the way in, only to discover that they were a bunch of gay guys who probably had been at one of the nearby clubs/bars. Then there were the ex frat boy looking guys talking to each other in the aisle. To top it off this woman who looked like Pam Anderson before the implant removal was wearing what looked like a vinyl top and mini skirt with stiletto heels was waiting for the women's room. Bizarro world.

Oh yeah the bathroom was in atrocious shape when I used it. People missed the trash can AND the toilet in abundance. It reminded me of the Starlight.

I doubt I'll be going back unless I""m drunk or in need of some people watching.",2009-05-02 20:31:14

If you know you're having a party of 12, maybe they should've put us in a different location or more private area not at a table in the front of the restaurant that echos. 

The manager ended up comping us a few appetizers for the wait. He gave us the foccacia bread, gator bites, and artichokes. I'm not a gator fan but the flavor was very good and the artichokes are a must have. The bread was well, bread. 

The cocktails were also very good and those didn't disappoint. The daiquiris were spot on. The service at the bar wasn't very good but our server at the table was great. 

For entrees, mostly everyone got the fish which was very good but I got the braised short rib and I requested extra broth. It was delicious, that is a dish I will crave.

I definitely prefer their brunch over their dinner as it is cheaper and the food options are more diverse. One of my main complaints is that today we made a reservation for 1pm, got there and still waited for a table until 1:30, and didn't get served food until after 2. This was kind of disappointing for having had a reservation, and staff didn't seem to sorry either as they're used to being busy. They also had helllaaaaa outdoor AND indoor seating to the point where I was a little afraid to be around that many people with no masks on.

We ordered:
Fried Scallop Banh Mi (2/5): Man was this a let down. I love banh mi and also scallops, so what could go wrong! The scallops were extremely fishy smelling and the combo of flavors was not very appetizing, my friend and I both didn't really want to finish our halves.
Pork Belly Benedict (4/5): I've gotten this before and it was definitely better last time, but this time the pork belly was dry and stringy, and the home fries were like thin medallions as opposed to big chunks. 

Overall I like the vibe of White Dog and it is a nicer option on campus, but the food wasn't too impressive for the massive wait times needed. If you're looking for a good brunch I'd suggest Green Eggs Cafe or Cafe Lift!",2020-10-11 06:18:19

After seeing the rave reviews, just had to give this place a try.  The soundtrack and the clean yet outdated beach town diner vibe really hit the spot more than the food.  Beverly's drawings on the wall helped bring in the homey feel as well.  

The best and most unique thing about Bev's is the homemade fruit preserves on the table.  When we visited, the two flavors to choose from were strawberry and orange.  These spreads definitely improved the flavor of the food items.

My savory crepe was odd tasting, like two things that just did not go together.  It was too much crepe wrapped around bland eggs, bland ham, barely any cheese, covered with bland swiss cheese.  So bland that I could taste the refrigerator taste on the crepe.  Even adding salt did not help.  Maybe I am ordering wrong and should have gotten a side of hollandaise?

Croissant French Toast was just decent.  However, the regular baked croissant was light and fluffy, yet bland, but great with the fruit preserves added.

My wife and I were in a hurry, we had a lot of errands to run on this particular Saturday.  My wife puts in the order for two - 12 count nuggets, large fries, and drinks.  After arriving we are told that they don't serve fries before 10:30am.  Then why is it an option on the app?  I was told that app indicates that there may be a wait for fries, the female manager said ""that wait would be until 10:30""  It makes no sense.  She then offered to give me 3 containers or hashbrowns instead.  I wasn't interested in that and suggested that she give me a gift card for the difference because we stop in enough I would just use it for the fries some other time.  The manager was getting increasingly short with me at this point (why I don't know) and said: ""I can't just give you a gift card"".  I said: ""I don't want you to give me anything, I paid for fries I am not going to get can't I have that money on a gift card"".  She meant to say that she doesn't have the authority to give a gift card as part of a refund.  Finally, I just suggested that we cancel the order and ring it up again.  Which we did.  I went to join my wife at a table she had been sitting at in plain view.  I explained the situation to her.  We opened the app and the notification says ""Allow extra time for lunch items"" nothing about 10:30. nothing about not serving fries.  Get it together chick-fil-a.  Now we are sitting at this table watching people come and go. about 10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and ask if we can have our drinks awhile.  The manager says ""I didn't know where you went""  I WAS SITTING AT THE TABLE RIGHT THERE IN PLAIN VIEW, I screamed in my head.  So I take our food back and we eat.  On the way out I wanted to get a refill (diet Dr. Pepper rocks) and I the same manager takes my cup, I say ""thank you"" and she says ""YEP"" with a very sarcastic tone.  As much as I want to blame this manager for her rudeness and lack of caring, keep in mind all of this would have been avoided if either:
 A) They allowed the cooks to put french fries in a fryer before 1030am
or B) The app did not allow fries to be ordered before 1025am

We were immediately seated by the same server as last time (who was great both times). She took our drink orders and handed us the food and drink menus. Because the girlfriend and I had such a great experience with steak last time, and that I had recently read they have switched to USDA Prime steaks provided from Kincaid's, I knew we were in for a treat. We've had Kincaid's USDA Prime steaks before and we had such a great steak experience here last time.

So we both ordered the steak, rare.

There was quite a bit of a wait between ordering and the food arriving, but we figured it was due to a couple large parties in the dining area. And who knows how many people were ordering food in the bar area.

The food did arrive and it looked delicious.

Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving.

Neither steak had any pink in it. It was very clearly well done.

I cut into the steak to find any indication that it was cooked anything other than well done and I couldn't find any.

We discussed what we should do as we deliberated about sending the steak back.

I've never sent a steak back.

I don't think I've ever sent a meal back.

The server did come around eventually and she asked how everything was and we told her. We apologized for bringing it up, but asked if it could be re-done as this wasn't what we ordered. 

Our server, and one other who was helping her out, apologized profusely. She asked if there was anything she could get us and we declined. She took our food back and promised she'd get another pair of steaks out.  They didn't have to do that, but we felt they valued us as customers by doing so.


The steaks came out again but the results really didn't improve much. My steak had a little bit of pink in the middle, so it was medium-well at best. The steak tasted dry and just not at all similar to what I had 6 months ago except for the seasoning. It was still seasoned properly (not overtly salted like some steak houses do).

Our server came back and asked how everything was and she asked us to be honest. We told her it was slightly improved but still not cooked appropriately. We told her about our great steak and overall dining experience previously. We communicated that we know it wasn't her fault and we weren't going to send the meals back again. 

I was able to eat my steak but it really lacked any type of flavor that a rare steak would have. It was incredibly dry and only had a little pink in it.

My beer (Natural Liberty from Black Acre) was great. They obviously have a great tap set up as it tasted as if I got it from the brewery itself. 

The opera chocolate cake with home made whipped cream was exactly like how an opera cake should taste.

The nitro cold coffee was very bold and on point. Their coffee menu is what every coffee menu should aspire to.

The space is inviting enough, and it certainly is a prime location for a dinner-and-a-movie date. The waitstaff seems to push you to order more than you do but besides that minor annoyance the service is fine, if a bit overly friendly. My waiter actually plunked down in an empty seat to the delight of the giggling gaggle at the table catty corner to me to chat about the menu. It seems to be a stock platitude of waiters, ""I'd love to pull up a chair with y'all!"" but I can't say I've ever seen one do so before. He also was hell-bent on remembering my name. ""Lisa, right?"" ""What's your name again?"" ""Lisa....right? That's your name, Lisa?"" 

YES. 

But nice guy. 
As for the food, the plates came out as they were ready, without much delay. They do a great ceviche plate...the hamachi & the tuna ceviches are really delicious...In fact I'd call the tuna ceviche downright vibrant. Their spinach salad is quite good; nice cheese plate selection. I enjoyed the heirloom tomato & mozz ""sandwich"" of sorts...although I felt they drowned it a bit too much in oil and balsamic.

It was still the full hour before he arrived with the food.  We had a difficult time deciding who the burgers belonged to because they didn't match what we had ordered.    Our sides were tots/fries but one had sweet potato fries that no one ordered.  The burgers were over cooked and the bratwurst was burnt to a crisp (looked like they sat for quite a while) Toppings weren't correct.

It was rich and flavorful but the crust was quite sodden except around the edges. Also, the crust (white flour) had a peculiar flavor; it tasted like saltines or pretzels, distractingly so. I like pizza crust to have a pleasingly yeasty flavor and to not be overly salted. My partner's stromboli was a beautiful immense crescent, a burnished golden tone (do they paint it with an egg wash?). Inside were copious amounts of mozzarella, mushrooms, bell peppers, fresh spinach and eggplant, but also an overly generous helping of ricotta, which made it sloppy and quite difficult to serve and eat. The white-flour stromboli shell also had that odd saltine-pretzel flavor and, like the pizza, was breadlike rather than doughlike (did not have the typical chewiness).

Great news - no buyer's remorse here! It was absolutely delicious and comforting.

When we walked into the venue, security was absolutely RIDICULOUS and extremely rude. Kicking people out who were 21 and over, constantly harassing people who didn't even have drinks in their hands. They had 5 choices of alcohol (including boxed wine which was of the lowest quality) and one type of beer. They claimed it was ""open bar"" but they didn't let us order drinks at dinner, which was absolutely horrific considering we paid for an open bar the whole night. 

The space that we rented out was extremely small. We were crammed in their lobby and unable to even see the theater which we also rented as well. They also did NOT have cell service or WiFi of any sort which was ridiculous for how long we were there for. 

The food was another story. It tasted like it came from an elementary school cafeteria that was briefly microwaved. While also telling us to serve ourselves with plastic plates and silverware. The chicken looked like soggy bread, and the vegetables were RAW. While also making us eat upstairs and closing the downstairs so we couldn't even get drinks, unbelievable. 

For a venue that claims to offer many areas to explore, delicious food, and high quality drinks, they are obviously better at lying than doing their job. I would never go back here. Please take your money elsewhere.",2019-05-05 18:41:12

I've always had outstanding service at the bar too.  I don't know what it is but the bartenders are just amazing.  Even when they're swamped, they always turn to me with a smile and seem happy to fill my glass. 

Although I've been to Khyber a few times since they opened for special drinking events, it took me a few months to actually sit down and eat there.  The food is very good.  My first bite in to their pulled pork sandwich was filled with smokey delicious pork bark.  Really delicious.  As a meat eater, I was still very impressed with their non-meat options.  I'm sensitive to the needs of others and recognize that this could be a great vegetarian destination.  At the same time though, I felt that took away from some more delicious meat that could have been on the menu.  The server we had was amazing.  Very friendly and well attentive to our needs.  Something was forgotten on one of our dishes but she realized it before we even had a chance to bring it up.  She made the fix and comp'd part of our meal for that.

BUT they have managed to perfect enough things to make this a great dining experience that no visit to Tampa should be without.  

First the good:  

The atmosphere is simply awesome.  This place oozes nice fine dining with an old world fee that I crave.  The service is pretty decent most of the time.  They can also handle large groups since the restaurant takes up the better part of a city block.  They also have some very interesting traditional and non-traditional dishes that are usually done very well and can make some of the harder items such as paella.  A good paella is hard to come by.  The pricing is also pretty decent.

The bad:

This place is usually super crowded so this is not the place for a quiet or quick meal.  There are many odd and bad things on the menu.  Other items are made inconsistently like why does my Cuban sandwich only have 1 tiny round pickle slice on the whole sandwich?  

Also EVERY SINGLE DRINK THAT THEY MAKE OTHER THAN SANGRIA IS TERRIBLE!!!!  Seriously, you would think a one hundred year old Spanish restaurant could make a Mojito!  I had one 3 times as good for half the price at the cigar shop (La Herienca De Cuba) down the street.  Come on guys, you should know that you DO NOT SHAKE A MOJITO!  You stir it to not shred the mint!  I asked about this and they said that is how management wants it.  Shame on you management.  I also HATE their Hemingway Daquari's (no fresh grapefruit juice which makes it too bitter), their Caipirinha (tasted like bitter soda water), and their Manhattan (way too sweet like they didn't add bitters or added simple syrup which is wrong).  The Sazerac that I had wasn't bad and they have excellent sangria so don't waste your time on the drinks unless it is sangria.  

I was also give the distinct impression that I was at a kitchy cruise ship show when I watched their dancing show.  I was hoping for authenticity not a touristy feel good dance show.

But overall the experience of the beautiful surroundings and uniquely prepared food outweighs the negatives (though I am still hung up on the Mojitos.  Shredding the mint?  Really?).  And watch out for their anniversary when they offer their traditional dishes like the 1905 salad at their original 1905 prices!  You can't beat that!",2013-08-07 21:42:24

The parking lot is extremely cramped and honestly quite terrible for your tires - and it was a little hard to find. It's a cute little place that resembles more of a house than a restaurant, but I think the exterior really added to the ""homey"" feeling. When you first walk in, you can take a peek at their specials & menu before you order. The kitchen is open faced, so they make the food right in front of you and you get to see them scoop out your various side dishes. I'm personally not a fan of the open-faced kitchen concept, mostly because if you sit too long to chat with your friends while you eat, then you leave the restaurant smelling something awful.

The food wasn't impressive. I ordered the All American veggie burger with pita bread & sriracha hummus on the side. The patty was so plain! I was reading the reviews and most people said that the burgers were so well made that I didn't need condiments - but I definitely needed condiments. I wasn't fond of the texture either. I'm a huge fan of veggie burgers, but this didn't really make my top 10 list. I really liked the sriracha hummus though! But 4 pieces of pita for a HUGE bowl of hummus wasn't a great ratio - it allowed me to take home more than 3/4ths of what I was served to save for later, so it wasn't a total loss. The pita bread was good and paired well with the hummus.",2017-09-22 01:22:23

I had heard about District Donuts from a blogger living in the area (shout out to Joy the Baker!) and, in the 40 hours that I spent in NOLA, District Donuts was on my list of places to go.  I purchased donuts for 3 other people & myself.  After my slightly hunched-over bike ride (with the box of donuts in my book bag, naturally), our 4 delectable donuts made it safely (and only slightly smooshed) in time for breakfast.
Between the four of us, we sampled the Vietnamese iced coffee, the NOLA cream, the wedding cake, and the toasted coconut donuts.  I can only speak to the flavor of the Vietnamese iced coffee donut.  The glaze was insanely good! Sweet and just the right amount of bitter with some grounds on top.  As a coffee enthuasiast (and barista), I was in caffeine and breakfast/dessert heaven.  The cream inside had a slight hint of coffee that left me licking my fingers to the last bite.  My fellow donut eaters were equally impressed! 
If I am ever in the NOLA area again, I will definitely make a trip back to District Donuts.  The staff was friendly and helpful; happily willing to explain the ins and outs of their flavors to a DD newbie.  Like many other places I have frequented in my life, this place was effortlessly cool/hipster. I felt like I gained 1 or 2 cool points just by walking in the door, in addition to all of the deliciousness that ensued when I walked out.

I got the pulled pork, 3 rolls and the cornbread. The rolls are similar to those potato rolls you get at target or Walmart. I love them so freaking much so I have no complaints. 

The pulled pork was so freaking good. Like I said I got a tiny portion. I put home hot sauce and their sweet sauce and it was heaven.

Our servers were attentive without being obnoxious, and nice enough to allow us to switch to a sunnier table when the shadows started covering us.

My one major complaint, however, were the wings.  At first bite, I thought I was sold. It was plump, juicy, and the hot sauce was kicking without hurting my skin.  I soon realized the consistency was not the name of the game when it came to the wings.  In the one pound order (which was about 8 wings), there were itsy bitsy ones, REALLY dry ones, and about 2 solid, delicious wings. Two were seriously lacking in the meaty department, and I was sorely disappointed that I peaked too early with my initial wing.

When they first opened it was so exciting to have new options in DTSP, including some really good bao. They have gradually slipped. The quality is ok but not great, often items are just too greasy, and what is supposed to be an elevated take on pan-Asian street foods ends up being more like cheap takeout, at triple the price. Portions are small, you're meant to order tapas style and get 2-3 items for your meal, or a bunch to share for a family. 

Last time I dined here with four adults and one toddler. There was not one thing the toddler would eat; no kid-friendly menu, and I'm not looking for your standard from-the-freezer chicken tenders, just a couple of items that could be dished in a pared down way for a child- everything came covered in spices, garnish, or pepper/onion topping that was not labeled on the menu. We ordered 14 plates and left with a strange combo of unsettled by too much grease, yet not full. Not a great experience, but especially not one that jives with the pricetag. 

Over the months, my favorite menu item, the duck bao, has had less and less filling, to the point where last time it was about an 85%/15% bun to meat ratio. More than once I have had unfortunate pieces of meat in that tiny portion, including fragments of bone and unchewable cartilage. There is clearly a quality control issue here, and it makes me sad to say, because in the beginning (and we tried Hawkers the first week they were open) we loved this restaurant, and have brought many people there. They also stopped carrying my favorite sake, and didn't really replace it with a comparable option (at least IMO, I'm picky!)

All in all, we will probably return at some point, as it is a convenient place to bring a group when working Downtown, and the atmosphere is cool. But Hawkers is now close to the bottom of our ""let's eat there!"" list, when it used to be near the top.",2017-08-21 23:23:53

This event that i was attending was supposed to be private so you can imagine my surprise when the small room we were using was stuffed full of people that were not in the group. I decided to shrug that off and make my way up to the bar, where i was met with some of the slowest bar tenders i have ever seen. They just didn't seem to be prepared in any way shape or form for us and even when they saw the amount of people standing at the bar one would think that there shoes were stuck to the floor. Once I got my drink I was very excited to try it because it was made with Indianapolis' own Hoosier Mama Bloody Mary mix and I do have to admit that the mix was delicious although I cannot be sure that any alcohol was in the drink. 
The food that I did get to tr y was good, but I felt like the whole time i was there i had to keep one eye on the food table because there was just not enough to go around and the minute something was put on the table it was gone. 
The food was decent but the service was bad enough that i will not be returning.",2012-07-26 19:34:48

The first two, the crab ragoon and bao buns weren't served hot. The ragoons were a bit chewy and were warm. The bao buns were OK, but the chicken was sort of tough and minimized by the huge bun. Again, it also was just warm food. I'm not one to complain too much if the food isn't piping hot and also good, but the flavors weren't amazing and neither was the temperature of my food.

The pumpkin beers were outstanding.  Southern Tier Pumpking was  a crowd favorite (slightly sweet, vanilla flavor) and it's not surprising they ran out part-way through the evening.  Weyerbacher, Brooklyn, and Dogfishhead were other favs.  However my personal favorite (that some others didn't like) was The Brewery's autumn maple.  It didn't really taste like maple, or autumn for that matter.  It reminded me of a Belgian triple, and is strong and dark... the way I like my men.  It might in fact be one of my new fav beers.

The pumpkin-inspired menu was a fun addition to their regular menu - pumpkin french toast, pasta, soup, and cake.  I snagged the last order of the pumpkin plantain soup and happy I did.  And they were basically giving away pumpkin pies.  The deal was supposed to be drink 4 beers and get a pie, but my friend just asked about the pies and was given one on the spot.  Good deal!  So what if it was a little burnt around the edges... I don't turn down free baked goods when I'm drinking.

A bunch of yelpers and others there for the pumpkin event made the small space even more crowded.  They seemed a little unprepared for such a crowd, and could have benefited from some extra servers.  I gather that their usual saturday afternoon crowd though is probably pretty sparse.  Even in the small space however, my gang was able to congregate around a table at one end with plenty of space.

While it's a fine neighborhood bar, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here on a regular basis.  But the pumpkin event was brilliant and a great way to spend an afternoon!",2009-10-04 23:12:55

I've been to the first location in Chalmette numerous times so when I saw signage for a location on the Westbank close to my job I was pretty excited. 

The renovations to the space are really nice and the staff whom I recognize from the other location are as nice as they've always been. The food and service has improved tremendously after my first initial visit. I wanted to give them a chance to work out all the kinks before writing this review. So here goes...

I've only had the crawfish roll from here as far as sushi is concerned...so I can't really comment too much on the Specialty Rolls. As far as the hibachi is concerned it could use some finesse. They aren't cooking the items in from of you like traditional hibachi rather in the back with the rest of the items. Each time the food has been kind of on the salty side. We asked our waitress to tell the kitchen staff low sodium and they semi got it right the next time. The hibachi rice while flavorful was soaked in oil/grease...they hit a home run on the salmon, shrimp and veggies. 

On my last recent visit I ordered the steak bowl entree (Donburi). It was amazing! Flavorful, smothered steak with grilled onions and egg over white rice. And a super large portion for lunch AND CHEAP! They also offer this entree with chicken as well. It just might be my go to from now on when I visit. I've also had the seafood Yaki Soba (not pictured...Sorry) that was pretty good as well. 

I enjoy this place alot...the kitchen staff just needs some practice and to be consistent with the dishes. 

All in all...its a decent place to grab lunch. I'll be back for sure. Oh and they do delivery too!",2016-01-13 20:05:21

We went for our first visit to Om, on River, just west of Campbell on the north side. The entrance is on the side, east of the porch area. We've eaten (happily) at Neo of Malaka, owned by the same folks, located on Broadway. We wanted to try this location, too.

We entered into a lovely ultra modern great room, creatively decorated in silvers, and grays, with splashes of color and many Buddhas and Asian touches, with a gorgeous white marble underlit bar. Our server was new, and admitted that we were his first customers. I promised to give him a hard time (just kidding! I was glad he said that, so we could be excellent first customers). We ordered two appetizers, the spring rolls and a shrimp dumpling type soup with greens. He had done his homework and really knew his menu. Good training. Very caring young man, too.

I had a little concern as our appetizers had not arrived after a substantial wait. And we could not find our server to ask the status. We flagged down another, who promptly checked on our order. Within a minute, our spring rolls materialized magically, with a profuse apology. The soup arrived separately, about 5 minutes later, with another apology. We don't know the reason for the delays, but I am glad I asked the status. The spring rolls were attractively served and very delicious. However, a few demerits for a very greasy egg roll wrapping. My mom only ate one as she was afraid of too much grease. The soup was very tasty. Gary said the dumplings were fried (or perhaps pan fried?).

Gary ordered the Malay Seafood Sambal, with a spicy chili sauce. It had eggplant and onions with shrimp and I believe scallops (I never got a sample of those but Gary did share a shrimp!). Very attractive, tasty dish with adequate quantity. Mom and I ordered the Thai Panang Curry with chicken -- with a special request for ultra mild for my mom. She can't do spicy at all. The dishes arrived, beautiful to behold and with a tower of brown rice (you can opt for white or brown rice!). The entree sat in a square bowl, in a soupy coconut milk-based curry sauce, filled with carrots, snow peas, a very healthy portion of chicken and a few other vegetables. 

It was very tasty. However, I could see mom picking at hers because it was still too hot--despite the fact they added more coconut milk to water the curry sauce down. A spice-sensitve person should probably avoid eating curry as the curry mix is already somewhat hot by nature. Mom mixed in the rice to gentle the spice a bit. She and I enjoyed the flavor and the dish. The entrees cost in the range of $12.95 - $15.95 each. I could tell that this restaurant strives for a high standard of food quality, service and friendliness. We'll be back (but probably will skip the spring rolls).",2012-06-15 04:19:19

While it came with some olive oil and herb dipping, I wasn't impressed with that and preferred dipping this in hummus.

Here's what the two of us shared:
* Med East Platter ($11): Roasted garlic hummus, lentil mustard salad, stuffed grape leaves and tzatziki. I loved every single thing on this platter, but the hummus was so good and I dipped the pita and the chip strip things I mentioned before in this. Pretty much cleaned every bit off the plate!
* Moroccan Braised Lamb Shank ($19) with Basmati rice and garlic sautéed green beans: The meat fell off the bone really easily and was so rich in flavor, but I'm a little weak when it comes to spicy food so I found myself sweating a lot haha...but it was a good kind of kick!

Good Food Ideas With Room For Improvement, Friendly but Kinda Slow Service, Odoriferous Parking Lot

Overview:
My friend and I rolled up midway through our afternoon bicycle ride from the Saint Louis County (Mehlville) area for some much needed sustenance, as neither of us had lunch yet. Sadly, we rolled too far back into the property because we were immediately hit with a foul smell. Not the first smell you want when fixing to have a meal! More on that below. I knew from Facebook a benefit was underway for a wounded employee of the restaurant, details of which are below, as well. Given that, I think the outside setup of Byrd and Barrel was thrown a bit out of kilter, as well as the service, unfortunately. Even though it was a Sunday, we were still under a time crunch as we were losing daylight for our ride home.

Outside Seating/Parking Lot:
Even though it was closer to the the ""uncomfortable"" side in terms of outside temperature, I must admit we caught some shade to help bear the Saint Louis heat. Sitting outside at a chicken joint just seems right to me. The outside furniture they have setup, which I am sorry I did not get a picture of for this review, is made up of primarily wooden benches and tables which I found comfortable, but not comfortable enough for you to fall asleep post-meal. 

Unfortunately, that Saint Louis heat I mentioned was cooking whatever was in the dumpster because it made the area near the drive-thru smell awfully foul. 

One thing I can tell you, after sitting outside and hearing several drive-thru orders, this was the best sounding microphone/speaker setup I had ever heard. Take that with a grain of salt though, I generally avoid drive-thru ordering whenever possible.

Food:
MotherClucker ($9) with a side of Mashed Potatoes and Gravy ($3):
This was my buddy's order. When I asked him about it, he said the sandwich had too many flavors going on. The side of potatoes and gravy had been sitting out a while.

Rippy Pie ($6) and Bahn Mi ($8):
My first impression of the 'Rippy Pie', which is described on the menu as having a veggie gumbo base, tasted like a dressed up smoother version of refried beans. The dish was something I would order again, based on taste. However, I felt $6 was a bit steep. On the other hand, the Bahn Mi had a great presentation with wonderful flavors of fresh carrot, cilantro, jalapeno, and I believe pickled cucumbers which added to the fried chicken livers well. The chicken livers seemed a bit over breaded/fried, but not terrible. I would order the sandwich again, but not before I had tried some of the other menu items first. 

Service:
As I mentioned, a benefit was going on when we visited. This may be the source of what I thought was a delay in first getting waited upon, to getting follow up visits to our table and receiving my first course. After taking some time to get that very first course, I was at the point of leaving, to be honest. I must admit, however, as we ordered more food the service did improve.  

Summary:
My judgement is still up in the air on this restaurant. I definitely plan to give it a second visit as I think the restaurant has some unique offerings. More than likely though, my order will be made up of less risky selections and pick some items that are their ""bread & butter"". 

Side Note for OPER Users:
OPER is no longer accepted at this restaurant.

It definitely has a great vibe going on and the wait staff  follows suit. The whole wrapping of the package is a win with me. In fact, that part receives 5 stars. 

Where they fail me is with the food. I have been here multiple times so I have given them many chances to wow me with the Mexican food. They have not. The menu is to the point. They focus on taco's and rice bowls. I have tried a variety of taco's (fried fish, blackened fish, oyster, chicken, pork, steak) and they are lacking in flavor to me. They are easy to eat, as they are very very small. I like the size because that makes them manageable. The  guacamole and salsa with chips were just ok. Same as the sides we had. I would like to try one of their rice bowls. They looked good and a gentleman near by said his was great. I'll go back to give this a go.

The cocktails are all hand crafted. Fresh fruit and juices are used. They have a nice variety. They certainly are a hit. 

Bartaco does not take reservations. They do however, accept call ahead seating. Quite the line can develop while you wait to be seated.",2016-06-07 01:54:09

Vedge is one of the city's most popular restaurants likely because it provides an underrepresented niche cuisine, vegan and vegetarian, done very well, served in a beautiful, upscale atmosphere. There's no denying the food at Vedge is worthy of its many accolades. The food is creative. It's beautiful. And it's delicious. Sometimes, it's astonishingly delicious. However, the experience as a whole falls short on so many levels.

The three times I've dined at Vedge, spaced out over the course of four years, starting from shortly after it opened, I couldn't help but feel squished and timed. Vedge is an experience. For many of the guests who are not vegetarians, a first visit feels like dipping a toe into the pool to test the waters. ""A whole meal of /just/ vegetables?"" One might ponder. ""Am I going to leave hungry?"" ""What's /so good/ about a bunch of simply stated flora?"" Which brings me to my next point....food should be fun, a conversation piece, to be savored.

The three times I've made reservations, our table hasn't been ready. The seating in the dining room is tight; we were shoulder to shoulder with other guests. It seemed like the Owners were prioritizing fitting as many people in as possible with little regard for the downside of commensurately lessening their patrons' experiences. Our table of two felt awkward not engaging our neighbors.

Seating aside, we usually order almost one of everything in each section of the menu. We usually enjoy three courses: appetizers, entrees, and then dessert. We are pretty fast eaters and never linger over coffee or tea after the meal. But it always feels as if they are rushing us along. Reservations are scarce and we are lucky to be fit in, but I'm not reserving a high pressure meal. It detracts from the experience.

The last time I called to make a reservation, the hostess assured me that the manager would return my call about placing a cake order. He never called me back. I won't forget to mention the time that they lost our group of 8's reservation for my mother's birthday. We were relegated to a sitting room with a mishmosh of tiny side tables to huddle around in our mismatched chairs.

I myself am restaurant professional and my job is to provide guests with an exceptional experience. I want to make guests feel valued and special and like we value their business. 

While Vedge has great food, it does not make its diners feel special, nor does its service exceed the bare minimum required. I hope that more plant-based upscale dining restaurants open, to give diners more options, but more importantly to create a competitive environment in the vegetarian arena. Hopefully Vedge will become more cognizant of their shortcomings, rather than wade in their lukewarm vegetable broth of complacency.",2015-11-01 23:15:23

Normally, I meander through exhibits on my own, but today I decided to take the free guided tour. I have to say having a tour guide really made a difference. The woman could have been a little more friendly - I felt she was a tad brusque in her answering of questions - but her knowledge of quilting, quilt design and the Gee's Bend aesthetic made up for her demeanor. Since she had met with the women/artists when they came for the opening of the exhibit so we was able to share all sorts of little bits of stories with us. The quilts were absolutely stunning and I'm inspired to break out the sewing machine. I really enjoyed the photography mini exhibit at the beginning with intimate portraits of some of the artists. The 28 minute documentary at the Perelman center was a great addition and another way to ""meet"" the quilters. I like that the museum continued the exhibit in Perelman by adding examples of Victorian and Amish quilting. This is only the second time in my life that I have bought the ""coffee table book"" of an exhibit, but I was so taken with the Gee's Bend exhibit that I couldn't resist.

Unfortunately, so were a LOT of other mudders. To add insult to injury, CMA fest was taking place the same weekend in Nashville.

Based on the stellar reviews and the belief that everywhere would either have a wait or be closed at that point, we got a beer and waited. 

As for beer, They have an interesting tap selection. It's very worldly, but only had 2 locals. I had a Little Harpeth high water as a 20 oz. you can order a 12 or 20 oz OR a liter. The liter glasses are huge. 

We all quickly ordered our burgers and a could of us went with the famous Farm burger: a burger topped with bacon, ham, and a fried egg, sandwiched between their house made sourdough bun. Wow. I can see why so many people have recommended it on Yelp. It was easily one of the top 3 burgers I've ever had. Perfectly cooked to a medium rare, a little greasy, but so juicy and flavorful. The egg was hard cooked, but still added so much flavor. The combination of flavors was very complex. Highly recommended. 

As for the sides, the server recommended the tots. In my opinion, they were the same as your frozen tots from any other restaurant. I tasted someone else's sweet potato fries, which are hand cut in house. They were tasty, but nothing special. Clearly the burgers are the focus.

Ordered the Spicy Minced Pork Chinese Hamburger and it was a bit disappointing for me. I'm not really sure what the outer layer was, but it wasn't toasted long enough and it kind of tasted like an English Muffin. The Pork was also kind of dry and the combination of dry bread and meat was so dry it gave me hiccups. It was also so oily that it began to seep through the bag they give you. It eventually got on my pants, which now I have something to remind me of this experience. 

I wouldn't recommend getting the Chinese Hamburger here. I'm confident that there's other places in Philly or maybe in NY that has better ones and I'd be willing to try again.

Even though their pizza has continued to be delicious and well-prepared, as of late we have noticed a precipitous decline in service.

For a place that specializes in meats, I had a lot of trouble processing how their burgers could be so mediocre. 

Their Royale burger ($14) was just all right and is a bit pricy for a burger that comes with American cheese and does not come with any fries. Their Grilled Bison burger did come with some soggy fries, but it was also $23. I ordered it medium and they overcooked it, so it was gray and tough. The toppings (boursin cheese, cabernet & balsamic glazed red onions) looked good on the menu, but did not really add any flavor in real life. 

Their appetizers were also overpriced and underwhelming. We got the Stuffed Portobello Mushroom Caps ($10) and Grilled Peach and Baby Spinach Salad ($12). The salad tasted fine, but only had a few slices of peach and was arranged flat on an oblong plate as if to make it look bigger, while the mushroom cap was on the smaller side and was topped with what seemed like a small amount of overcooked spinach with a little bit of cheese. There was nothing to justify paying $10 or more on each of these items. 

Maybe we picked all the wrong menu items and their other items are better? Unfortunately, I'm not sure I'll be back to find out after spending almost $100 on a mediocre meal for two.",2017-09-13 18:16:16

I have wanted the chicken, which lists as for 2, and was finally able to get a family member to share with me. Thankfully it was my son because the chicken is a full meal and easily could feed 3. I think the bird is deep fried for the crispiest of skins. Sitting on a bed of kale and potatoes, the dish is full of good food. I am pretty sure a few more chickens were ordered once they saw ours come out of the kitchen. It takes 30 minutes to prepare and thus is not a rush order. We all tasted each others meals and I would have enjoyed any of them.

But not everyone was eating chicken so we had started our meal with lots of smaller plates before the main dish. Charred green beans was the surprise winner this time, served as a cold salad. All small plates are priced about the same, however the quantity on the plate does vary. So meat will not necessarily be a better ""deal"" than vegetables. Next, all of the small plates were set out family style which let everyone to get a taste. Desserts were also served with a large spoon in case you are feeling generous to the rest of the table. Apple cobbler with fresh ice cream (get your own).

Don't forget your molasses cookie as you leave.

Josephine is an upscale restaurant and I love it. Our waiter wasn't as engaging this time but I left grateful for every bite. Next on the wish list is to come to one of their 10x10 chef table events.",2019-10-22 14:13:42

 The guy who answered the phone and who greeted us when we came in was very nice (Brian?). The decor is fun. Reclaimed wood. Industrial chic. The food was a mixed bag and there were problems with items we ordered.. It's also pretty pricey. Ultimately I had more fun at Lenny's diner up the road and got a much better value for my moolah.

The lemon ricotta pancakes were very good. Flavorful. Thick. Nice touch of lemon zest. The syrup was NOT maple syrup. The waitress said it was 90% maple syrup. What is that? I've never even heard of that.  It was NOT maple syrup. Log Cabin or some such fo sure.

The New York Strip brunch steak n eggs special was cooked a nice medium rare. Tasty steak. Small. The sweet potato hash was incinerated and black on one side. Gross. They brought a replacement side that was underdone, soft, and not desirable. Gilden brown or don't bother with it. The fried eggs were okay. Pretty spendy though, and while the steak wasn't as chewy as your diner fare it was MUCH smaller and had a layer of fat all along one side.

The Noble Pig house specialty pizza was pretty good but somewhat disapponting. when i picked up my slice the while topping mass slid off. It was almost like a stuffed crust type pizza. more is not always better and it was a bit of a greasy mess althoigh it had decent flavor. definitely not one of the best pizzas I've had as far as flavors, texture, crust or ingredient mix goes. Also they forgot the egg. Then brough one as a side and went ahead and charged us for it. ummmm.. NO.

I'll get right to point, the food was way too salty.  I expect more from Garces, and have dined at most of his restaurants and loved it.  Perhaps his lunchtime chef is heavy-handed.

Anyways, I had the Galician soup. which was wonderful, piping hot, nicely balanced between spice and earthy meaty and beany goodness.  There were some greens sprinkled on top which gradually melted into the soup.  A little creme fraiche cheesy item on top.  Yum.  The soup was a little salty, but I attributed that to the sausage in the soup.  I think in retrospect I was wrong.  Everthing in the soup was salty.  Read on.

The pork sandwich was very tasty, it featured some red cabbage slaw in it for a nice sweet and sour tang.  The red pepper aioli dressed it.  Aioli, salty.  Pork, salty.  Cabbage, salty.

The fries on the side were oversalted, as was a second dressing of the same aioli.  Why twice?  

By the time I was 2/3 of the way through I began to quaff large gulps of water, they had to refill my glass 3 times.

I tried the gorganzola pasta, withheld the peppers, and added chicken.  I've had gorganzola sauce other places and made myself before, but this was sooo strong that it was almost bitter.

Hubster had fish and chips.  The fish was weird like hardly any meat but all breading made to look like their tenderloins.  The oil tasted very used and you could tell it was shared with their tenderloins.  Hubster took one piece home and the next day I broke it open to look at it  --it was all breading with clumps of thick orange oil and very little white fish. Yuk

I tried the nachos and mussels as an appetizer. We added chorizo to the nachos which was delicious. I really enjoyed the avocado cream which worked even better than sour cream. The mussels were also delicious and fresh tasting. Just the perfect amount of spiciness in the broth, good stuff. I also had their version of a burger which came with yuca fries (pretty bland).

I LOVE the beer at Hollister. They brew their own beer and have a wide variety of choices, including Belgians, IPAs/pales, ambers, and stouts. They usually have one of their ambers on cask, which is my favorite. If you've never had a beer on cask, but you like creamy, smooth, rich beers that aren't on the ultra hoppy side, I highly recommend you ask your server about this. 

The only reason I give Hollister 4 stars is because of the food. Most of their menu is alright, but nothing spectacular. The two best things on the menu in my opinion are the pulled pork sandwich with duck fat fries (which is actually on the specials menu, come on Hollister just make this a regular item!) And the Cobb salad. 

So if you are looking for an awesome afternoon of sports, go to Hollister, split the Cobb and pulled pork sandwich with your significant other, and get a few beers on cask ;)

Right away I HATED the waiter! A wormy, snob-wannabe with a bad attitude waiting tables at 40 years old.
I told him I knew what I wanted and he interrupted me saying he ""had to tell us the daily specials"".
He informed us all the steaks were ala carte, which is just a way to charge more for a dinner that everybody expects will have a baked potato and salad.
I ordered the potato and salad seperately and when the snotty waiter brought the salad my friend and I both laughed (see next photo) - It was pathetically small and made with wilted, purple lettuce and one carrot strip, $5.25!!! It tasted like crap, I hated it!
The potato was good but the waiter claimed it was "" a HUGE potato, about a foot long!"" - it wasn't.
The steak was good sized piece of meat but it did not come out sizzling like I expected in a pricey steak house, $26.50 for the steak alone!- I expect it sizzling and cooked to perfection. I ordered medium-well and the meat was bleeding in the center. There were a few good bites, but there was also a lot more fat and gristle than you would expect from ""nice"" restaurant.
I actually had to walk to the bar and ask for my Coke to be re-filled because the waiter was nowhere around.
At the end of MY meal the waiter took my plate and grabbed my friends plate WHICH STILL HAD STEAK AND POTATOS ON IT WHICH HE WAS STILL EATING!!! 
My friend who is more forgiving than I, finally spoke-up and said something to the waiter and the manger before we left.

Always friendly (except one younger girl who constantly seems to have an attitude problem), online ordering is super convenient and the food has always been great. EXCEPT recently. I've been to Deke's twice in the last month-ish (both times since the garage location has closed - maybe something to do with that?) and the food has been mediocre at best. It's a real bummer, especially because you're easily spending $15 on a meal. No fried mac the last two times - which has never happened before. Was subbed with regular mac one of those times and it was very oily. I didn't eat more than a bite or two. One order was the Sloppy Doc which has typically been pretty loaded with pulled pork - enough that it's a filling meal. The order a couple weeks ago had hardly any pork on it whatsoever, and I requested extra cheese sauce but there wasn't even as much as the normal amount on it. The potato wedges were even a little cold, making them chalky tasting. The most recent order (6/22/17) was a Smokin' Hog. The pork itself was fine, wedges again were cold and a little chalky, slaw was loaded with dry rub (??) and what used to be a super delicious brioche bun was replaced with a thick, tasteless, white roll.

Philadelphia has a relatively decent sushi scene in comparison to LA, NY, and SF. I've done by best to go through all the high end sushi spots in Philly before judging the city as a whole and I've been to the majority of the more well known ones (Royal, Zama, etc. but haven't hit Morimoto) and I can say that for the most, it's been enjoyable. Out of all the places I've tried, I can confidently say that Double Knot was the best and is on par with most tier 1- places in the larger cities. I forgot the name of the person that was serving me but he was essentially Kevin Yanaga's second hand man at the bar and he was really, really good. Even though he wasn't Japanese, it was clear that he was more than experienced and was super knowledgeable in regards to everything being served. Once I established that I was quite the sushi eater, he began serving more exotic pieces and interesting combinations that were beyond your typical soy or yuzu. He also made me one of the most decadent dishes I've ever had; a sublime mini chirashi of waygu, toro, and caviar topped with golf leaf. The meal was quite some time ago but it was one of the most memorable experiences I've had and it gets a solid 5 stars all around. 


With such a great omakase dinner, we were excited to try the rest of their menu. A group of four of us came and decided to do the Chef's tasting menu to really get the full experience. We began with a couple of cocktails. We tried four in total, the double knot, two lovers knot, savoy knot, and the re-animator. All were pretty interesting but I really enjoyed the double knot. In regards to the food, this is what we ended up getting:

Cold - Ceviche (3/5): a pretty prototypical ceviche. Nothing to write home about but the portions were very generous for the four of us. 

Specialty sashimi - Japanese Scallop (1/5): this dish was a complete miss for me. The tempura flake was really overwhelming and took away from the texture and the taste of the scallop. I would not order this ever again.

Crispy  - Japanese Fried Chicken (3.5/5): also a prototypical chicken karraage. Had nice flavors to it and I really enjoyed the daikon but I wish they would have given us more. The daikon to chicken ratio was way off but the portions of chicken were pretty generous. I also would have preferred the mayo on the side so that I could control how much mayo I wanted on my chicken. 

Small - Duck Scrapple Bao Bun (2/5): a lot of people raved about this particular dish but I did not find it that interesting. When I think of scrapple, I think of offal and taking all the weird parts of an animal and putting it together that'll have that metallic, funky taste. I didn't really get that here; it really just tasted like a bunch of duck meat compacted and put into a bao and hit with a heavy, sweet sauce. I didn't resonate with me. 

Robatayaki - Miso Eggplant (5/5): Get it if you like egg plant .

Robatayaki - Rib Eye Scallion (5/5): Get it if you like rib eye.

Robatayaki - Pork Belly (2/5): I was a little underwhelmed by this cut of pork belly. It wasn't super soft and didn't have any interesting flavors. I wish they had served it first instead of last because eating it after the two above probably made it more mundane than it really was.

Meat - Beef Short Rib (4/5): We were so full by this point and out comes an absurd portion of this dish. It had great flavors and it really reminded me of Asian/Vietnamese beef jerky so it's got that sweet/salty/umami thing going for it. It kind of felt weird making it into wraps with lettuce and sushi rice. That particular combination didn't work for me but the meat itself was on point. 

Fish - Broiled Seabass (5/5): They cooked this seabass perfectly. The texture of a well-cooked seabass is divine and this was no different. The flavors from the truffle soy were great (although you can never have too much truffle! And they most likely used an oil) and the peashoots were a great way to round it all off. 

Sides - Black Cod Fried Rice (5/5): This was so so so good! Really reminded me of Cantonese style salted fish fried rice but with more depth and a little less salt. 

Sushi - Toro (3/5): the rice was a little bit off today. It was a little bit too wet and didn't break apart properly when I ate it. Toro itself was decent but nothing compared to what I had received during my omakase dinner. 

The dinner was good, but it wasn't amazing. 3.5/5 is where I would put it and I really think it's a step above its sister restaurant next door, Sampan. All in, out the door, it was $380 for 4 people so it's not cheap! I think I'd rather go for the omakase if I can sit in front of the chef I had before!",2017-11-10 21:39:48

My boyfriend and I recently ate here a couple weeks ago and we were really impressed. First off, the atmosphere. It's pretty nice, though a bit noisy and the tables are scrunched together. I never felt like my privacy was being invaded, though.

I ordered a gaffe of ""Isle of Paradise"" sake at the recommendation of the server (who was nice and helpful) and we loved it. Delicious, light, and crisp. We ended up splurging on the chef's tasting, which is $45 and you get WAY too much food. We ordered the dish with the noodles, edamame and scallops - this was my boyfriend's favorite. The scallops were perfectly cooked. Also had the szechaun chicken which was very good. The edamame dumplings were very light and the broth they were in was delicious.

 The chicken satay was actually the only thing I didn't like that we had. I couldn't finish mine, so I gave it to the bf to finish and he enjoyed them. The crispy rock shrimp were good, but I think I prefer the crispy rock shrimp at Morimoto or Zento better. Too much lemon going on with this dish, so I don't think I'll order it again.  The chicken bao buns were amazing, easily my favorite dish we had. Pad thai is my favorite food in the universe, and the shrimp pad thai here did NOT disappoint. Definitely better than Buddakan's pad thai, hands down.

We finished off our meal with their soft serve ice cream, which was cinnamon toast crunch flavor and Swedish fish flavored. OMG. We wanted more. Super tasty! We can't wait to go back.",2013-04-09 18:11:50

They were out of seafood ceviche and duck confit (at 8pm on a slow Saturday), so we ordered the salmon ceviche, half dozen oysters, thai clams and pork shoulder (which was way too much food).

Our server wasn't very quick with anything and was completely clueless about the menu. He brought out four sauces for the oysters and it took him 10 minutes to figure out what it was. 

The food was amazingly good and the portions are enormous. The prices are reasonable for the food considering the portion size. I would like to see more variety on the menu to correspond with the season however. My pork shoulder with mashed potatoes was delicious, but a bit too hardy and would have been more of a fall dish than a summer dish.

The other downside is they charge WAY too much for booze. I had one of their ""specialty drinks"" which was just some Wild Turkey, ginger beer and bitters and my date had a well tequila with OJ and both were $9/ea and not very large. I ordered their IPA as well. Cant remember the price, but it was the worst IPA Ive had in as long as i can remember.

We were promptly greeted by our server and were brought glasses of water. My boyfriend ordered a glass of red wine, which he thoroughly enjoyed. I ordered a Patrón margarita, which was mostly mix with very little tequila. As a self-described margarita aficionado, this was a little disappointing.

However, the meal made up for the little annoyances I mentioned above. The lamb skewers were divine: perfectly seasoned and cooked to a nice medium consistency.

If you have already read my review of Geno's you could gather unless I'm half goat I was not impressed with the ""cardboard with cheese"" I had there... so to save you the suspense... Pat's wins in the one on one showdown of the tourist traps.

I went to Pat's second of the two, yes I was drawn to all the pretty colors at Genos and after eating there I figured out why they were needed to attract business.

Pat's service is mixed, the interactions with their staff and reading some of there signs can be taken as witty or rude. I guess you just need to have a sense of humor to enjoy their customer service, and afterall people are coming there for a show, i just dont know if they figured out comedy isn't their specialty.

Now on to the food... well it was not the best I have ever had but it was leaps and bounds over Geno's. To start it tasted like meat and not cardboard, I didn't need a small bucket to catch the grease and most importantly the word ""steak-umm"" never entered my mind.

It was good, was it worth $9, no, I'd say a fiver would be fair, maybe a six if you throw them a buck for the poor comedy routines. 

Its a slight improvemet over Wawa, but hey if your main compeition is Geno's I can see the lack of motivation to truly be the king of steaks.

We were on our way to Cafe Korea and my kids spotted a Japanese Steakhouse and sushi bar. I had never heard of this place and figured what the heck. Well I couldn't have been more wrong. While waiting for the other half of my brood we got a table and sat down. The kids ordered drinks and I chose to hold off on a drink until my wife and daughter got there. We waited about 10 minutes for my wife and I must say I was extremely annoyed by our miserable server.

She must have asked me this 10 times in 10 minutes and at least 20 times during dinner. I can be a little quirky at times so I refused even water! Which seemed to infuriate her. The experience was definitely decimated by this woman's miserable attitude and demeanor. The sushi was fair to poor. My wife opted for the sushi. I added a couple of things for me as well in addition to my teppanyaki meal. I love hotate or raw sea scallop. I ordered them nigiri style. They came out chopped and mixed with tobiko and spicy sauce spooned into little nori cups. Not what I wanted. Mrs Miserable said that's how they make it. It should have been described as a chopped spicy scallop. Not hotate nigiri! The teppanyaki chef was pleasant enough. I had Filet and Shrimp. This was not bad. My children got Shrimp and Chicken.

Wings are good too. I usually get them dry and have a couple different sauces on the side.

One of the most unknown items I would guess would be the old fashioned, flat-top burgers. 

Dude.

These are not fancy burgers, but still elevated with different ingredients, like pimento cheese and jalepenos on the Dixie burger. But if you want to change your life, order the brisket burger. Brisket on the burger with grilled onions & bbq sauce. I usually ask for them to put comeback sauce on mine instead of bbq sauce. And its like $9.

Their white sauce, which they suggest you use on chicken or turkey goes with everything. Its not as heavy on the mayo side as some white sauces and has just a little heat. Its awesome. 

Their sides are okay but you go for the meat.

I stopped in for a few drinks with friends and the atmosphere in the first floor bar was not exactly great since they had one of those pay tunes juke boxes.  The problem with it was no one was playing music since it was  a quiet night.  That meant the few people in the bar were subjected to the machine's auto-play cycle of replaying a song by Enrique or something.  That song played several times in a row but at random times.  When that jewel of a song wasn't playing the audio of the tvs would kick in.  So crap music/tv background noise.  
The beer was good but $13.50 per round for two drafts seemed a bit high for me.  The beer board had alcohol content but no prices listed so Im not sure which beer was the one that drove the price up.

I live near fishtown and have no shortage of better, cheaper, cooler places to hang.

I hope they rectify the music situation at least because that was just plain ugly.


Charlie C. has been nice enough to contact me regarding this review.  I appreciate that I misread the music situation, though the results were still unpleasant enough.  Maybe I should admit a couple things.  I want to go to a place to drink and enjoy some ambiance.  I dont like to pay for music.  If another patron does, and repeats the same song, I dont blame the bar.  If no one plays music, I dont want to listen to tv's.  In fact, I usually avoid bars with tvs but I can usually tolerate them if I dont have to hear them.  I thought most of those pay jukeboxes had a setting to randomly play music when no one payed for specific songs.  If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.  It's still a situation I dont enjoy.

As for the beer price.  It wasn't a huge deal, just a small thing.  Apparently the beer I had was $8.50 and it was delicious!  I just don't like the idea of a bar that doesn't tell you prices up on a board.  Maybe Im spoiled.  Frankly,I do not want to be in the position to have to ask how much each beer on a menu is in order to make my choice.",2010-05-21 12:11:54

Sure, you can find sweets here, but there really aren't many places to stop and have a unique snack. As for ""healthy"" desserts, I'm thinking that might be a bit of a stretch for most of what they offer but that is to say they serve up some mighty tasty dishes.

From what I gather, the desserts are Hong Kong style (correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not super familiar) and seem to be influenced by some of the popular street foods there. They serve things like Panna Cotta with red beans, bubble waffles, matcha ice cream, and butterfly pea tea. I was really surprised at their list of items, it is quite large!

My 3 star review is because I ordered a bubble waffle with matcha ice cream based on the display waffle they had. It looked large and extra fluffy and golden brown; however when it was served it was small, flat, and a bit overdone. The matcha ice cream also tasted old and freezer burned, and I was pretty disappointed. My husband got the panna cotta with red beans and it was very good. Another problem was that after we ordered it took a very long time (15+ minutes) to come out and we were the only people in the restaurant. The panna cotta was delivered first and by the time I got my waffle and ice cream he was almost done with his bowl. I would go back again if I was in the area to try something different, but I don't think I will be rushing back to that side of town just to go here. I think it's worth a try, especially for those who may be unfamiliar with Asian desserts and more unique flavors like red bean or matcha.",2018-11-26 15:03:04

Most important we didn't feel rushed by him either. I will go back again. Great service goes a long way for me, our server nailed it.",2018-08-05 21:07:48

UPDATE. Just revisited my beloved Cinco and sat at the corner of the already full bar. Then there was a seat jammed next to me by the bartender and the bartender asked me to move over so two other people could squeeze in, which was now overly cramped. Then the lady next to me (who he had me move for) distracted the bartender again while I was ordering and he tended to her. There wasn't enough room to eat a meal so I left and won't be back. How rude.

I guess I should continue, since this wasn't enough. The older lady next to me was so close that she hit her drink and her straw flew at me, as she and her husband loudly guzzled margaritas like nothing I've ever seen. To leave my seat was virtually impossible since the seats were now jammed together and laughably awkward. Their behavior should have been addressed, and I suppose that was also the bartender's fault, not the restaurant's. I will visit other cinco's, as this bartender is almost daily.",2017-10-06 21:08:11

The chicken pot pie was just meh. The waitress messed up my wife's order on her birthday. She asked for the ravioli with the bolognese sauce but just got plain sauce. We asked for the right sauce and it took close to 15 minutes to get a side of sauce. And when we would ask her a question while she was at our table she would stop us and say something like ""let me finish what I'm doing before you ask a quaetion"". Like she couldn't handle a simple question about the menu. No need to plan a return visit with all the other options around to try.",2018-12-03 13:53:31
